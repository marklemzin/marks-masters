Perhaps Sa can interfere with Pa quorum-sensing molecule diffusion...
We can try pqs-Ko in PA14 maybe.

The 'collapsing' of structure at the edges of colonies reminds me of the 'sloughing' theory of biofilm development.
Structure is a conseuqence of primarily horizontal expansion.

For PA14 mono:
0.5lb appears to form slightly smaller 'rosettes'
2lb forms slightly diffuse rosettes
0.5ag forms motility-dependent cloudbursts
