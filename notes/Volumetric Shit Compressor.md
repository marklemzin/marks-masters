Where Shit gets compressed. Into one sentence or fewer preferably.

*Strain association*
At the species level, *S. aureus* is more susceptible to *Pa* colonization than other *Staphylococci*. [Non-pathogenic *S. carnosus, S. piscifermentas, S. gallinarum* have an ETC resistant to *Pa* PAO1 respiratory toxins.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1698191/) 
PA14 can overgrow many different *Sa* strains over 16 hours. [Reference strains like Newman and USA300 are just as readily overgrown as clinical isolates. Both MSSA and MRSA strains are overgrown.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4524177/#sec19)

*Spatial localization*
[Biofilms grown attached to the plastic wells of a microtitre plate has *Sa* in pockets of growth surrounded by *Pa*.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2772425/)

Some *in-situ* analysis finds *Pa* and *Sa* localize within different environments in histological sections of chronic wounds. [*Pa* dives deeper into wounds than *Sa*.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2786634/) Evidence suggests towards *Pa* acting as a niche colonist rather than simply excluding growth of *Sa*. *Pa* microcolonies *in-vivo* form more complicated shapes than *in-vitro* - here the *Pa* border forms disjointed swirls suggesting an ununiform infectious front.
- LINK. *Pa* is a 'colonist' and forms leading-edges in infection.


*Agar biofilm esoterica: environmental factors*
Agar concentration can determine the complexity of biofilm structures. [Increasing agar concentration and thereby surface tension increases biofilm wrinkling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X04002604?via%3Dihub) - maybe by increasing the effects of cell-cell obstruction.
- GLOSSARY. Use 'complexity' in the context of 'complexing' - the complexing of many different parameters.

*Agar biofilm esoterica: living factors*
The resultant physical forces from localized cell death are [responsible for creating wrinkliness in colony biofilms of *B. subtilis*.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3503208/) High cell densities and fratricidal exotoxins are implicated in regions of cellular aggregation which eventually buckle under stress. The idea is interesting in that it breaks the orthodox perspective that cellular aggregation occurs exclusively on the adherent surface of the biofilm - but that resident cells can have localized internal aggregation patterns in even mature biofilms. [Evidence even exists in *P. dendritiformis* that macrocolonies necessarily want to exclude external colonization - possibly to promote the maintenance of a careful internal homeostasis.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2851949/)
Wrinkliness of *B. subtilis* biofilms has been postulated to increase atmospheric surface area and improve biofilm oxygen perfusion. [The justification being that micro-oxic conditions seem to promote colony wrinkling.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3650226/)
- LINK. Dietrich papers. Also concern oxygen limitation. He does not make the same connection as the *B. subtilis* paper.

*Agar biofilm esoterica: modelling*
Mathematical modelling is commonplace in papers about agar biofilms. The field has attracted the interest of biophysicists. A brief discussion of commonly-used mathematical parameters and variables is worthwhile to appreciate their biological implications.

[The logistical model of bacterial growth is frequently baked-in to models predicting microcolony size.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23003092/) The implication is that colonies have a limiting bacterial density per occupied plot and that the expansion is locally-limiting. Such models can be predictive of polymicrobial growth but *Pa* and *Sa* must be assumed to be a singular entity - I.E. that only a linear combination of *Pa* and *Sa* growth is predictive of *Sa* growth.

*Kinetics*
[*Pa* and *Sa* do grow in coculture conditions for the first 8 hours with nutritious media. Only in the period between around 8-10 hours to 24 hours of coculture *Pa* reduces *Sa* cell counts by the order of 10$^5$. ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2772425/) Species bearing a cyanide-resistant cytochrom *bd* oxidase instead coexist with *Pa*.

*Biofilm-associated protection*
Alginate production is not necessarily associated with *Sa* viability in coculture. [Both non-mucoid (I.E. PAO1, PA14) and non-mucoid (I.E. FRD1, SMC1585) strains of *Pa* can overgrow *Sa* over 16 hours. Removal of alginate production in *Pa* FRD1 (by *algT*::Tn) does not restore *Sa* viability.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4524177/#sec19) 

*Mechanisms of Pa domination*
*Pa* can detect polymicrobial conditions by recognizing phylogenetically distinct components of other bacteria. [Components of the Gram-positive cell wall GlcNAc and peptidoglycan *via* a 2CS encoded by PA0601 triggers production of virulence factors like pyocyanin, elastase, and PQS. PA0601 promotes *Sa* and *Pa* coexistence *in-vitro* and *in-vivo*. PA0601 promotes host mortality from peptidoglycan from avirulent local Gram-positive microflora.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2772425/) Induction of *Pa* virulence in polymicrobial conditions doesn't coincide with medical findings that polymicrobial wound infections are less virulent- suggesting that there is a yet-undiscovered genetic counterbalance to polymicrobial-induced *Pa* virulence.

[PA0601 was originally discovered from a characterization of *Pa*'s observed GlcNAc catabolism in CF sputum.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028681/) Cells do not necessarily perform catabolism for solely energetic purposes but can also sense the metabolic 'fingerprint' of the environment and respond accordingly. Even complex molecules like GlcNAc can be used as a environmental signal.

[Short-term coculture of *Pa* PA14 with *Sa* 8325-4 **doesn't** significantly dysregulate many genes in PA14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4524177/#sec19) but this may be a strain-specific effect. [8235-4 is a natural derivative of a *rsbU* mutant.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC161998/) [*rsbU* is an indirect activator of *sigB*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2668408/) - [a protein coordinating *Sa* adaptation to *Pa*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20113519/).
Only the MFS transporter PA_10470 is downregulated in PA14 when exposed to *Sa* 8325-4.

*Sa post-submissive response*
[8325-4 coculture with PA14 causes an upregulation of 33 genes at least 10-fold above monoculture levels and a downregulation of 150 genes at least 10-fold below monoculture levels. The vast majority of genes identified were hypothetical (essentially all genes downregulated more than 100-fold were uncharacterized), but some virulence factors (leukotoxin LukE) were downregulated and many genes involved in amino-acid catabolism (*ald1, tdcB, SAOUHSC_02933*) and fermentative metabolism (I.E. *pflAB, ldh, adh*) were upregulated up to 1000-fold above monoculture levels (S. table 5).](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4524177/#sec19)

The authors of the paper contrast the transcriptional response of *Sa* to *Pa* with the default transcriptional program of *Sa* SCVs. [SCVs strongly downregulate genes involved in fermentation (*adhP, ldh*) relative to wild-type parental strains - although genes involved in amino-acid catabolism are not significantly dysregulated (S. table 5).](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-024-03364-8#Sec222) [Coincidentally - *Sa* USA300 SCVs by knockout of *hemB* or *menD* are resistant to short-term killing by PA14.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4524177/#sec19) But the lack of difference in amino-acid catabolism is surprising given that SCVs are by definition amino-acid auxotrophs.

The metabolic transition was facilitated by *Pa* HQNO production (*pqsA, pqsL*).
- LINK. Add effects of HQNO on *Sa*.
[*Sa* does attempt lactate intake as it upregulates lactate permease. *Pa* seems to outcompete *Sa* for the products of *Sa* fermentation - acetate, ethanol, and lactate.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4524177/#sec19) *Sa* is unable to compete for carbon sources and switches to a program of amino-acid catabolism [normally associated with Glucose-replete environments such as wound abscesses.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5312079/)

Pyocyanin - another respiratory toxin - can induce SCV formation in *Sa*. Coculture with *Pa* and purified pyocyanin are cause induction of the SCV phenotype. [Sustaining the SCV phenotype requires consistent exposure to pyocyanin (or other factors found in *Pa* supernatant) else it reverses.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2772425/) [The mechanisms of reversion are diverse and correspond to the intensity of the mutation or epigenetic modification that led to the formation of SCVs initially.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6603916/)

SCVs are the best-characterized phenotypic group of *Sa* capable of coculture with *Pa* over extended periods of time. Mutants in [*hemB*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2772425/), ... are all show no reduction in viability when grown with *Pa* in coculture over shorter periods.
