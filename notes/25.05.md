*Again and again*

From the 23.05 root review.
[*Sa* virulence factors are at least partially responsible for the severity of polymicrobial wound infections](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0056846). *Pa* specifically induces upregulation of *pvl* and *hla* (a-haemolysin). Mixed biofilms also cause down-regulation of keratinocyte growth factors important for wound closure - contrary to multiple medical studies.
- *rhlI* is a component of *Pa* autoinducer synthesis alongside *rhlABC*. *algD* is involved in alginate synthesis.
- No effects of polymicrobial biofilms on cytokine expression. Supports the 'contaminated but not infected' perspective.
- *Pa* suppresses *Sa* expression of *spa* (*S.* protein A) *in-vivo*. *Pa* only increases *hla* expression late in *in-vivo* infection (day 4). *Pa* uniformly increases *pvl* expression.
XX~ A wound environment forms a stressful 'bubble' for *Pa* and *Sa* interactions. I suspect the equal effects of treatment with the novel environment and *Pa* have only additive effects. *Pa* provides a *redundant* stressor.

[A single pathogenic species can potentiate infections of other bacterial species not normally associated with infections.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22076151/)
- *Pa* overgrows murine surgical wound infections even from a starting proportion of 1% of the total inoculum in 2 days.
- *Pa* and *Sa* do not co-localize in 4-species biofilms with *F. magna* and *E. faecalis*. *Pa* forms a leading edge into the wound, the projections are remarkably similar to those seen at the colony's border. Considered hyper-virulent.
- Coinfection does not delay wound closure relative to monomicrobial *Pa* infection.
- *Pa* does not appear significantly more resistant to bleach and gentamicin in quad-species biofilms.
- Obligate anaerobes can survive in *in-vivo* wound infections (*F. magna*).

*Pa* and *Sa* coinfection supports greater bacterial density. 6-days after infection *Sa* predominates in *in-vivo* rabbit ear models but *Pa* PAO1 overtakes growth after 8-days. *Sa* UAMS-1 is never eradicated by *Pa*. [Both species co-localize](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22905182/). Biofilm production in *Sa* (UAMS-929, *sarA* deficiency - no biofilms) is not essential for forming polymicrobial biofilms.
	- [5.4 species per chronic venous leg ulcer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20082680/)
	- [106 possible species in a chronic wound](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2289825/). *Pa* is the most frequently-occurring species in venous leg ulcers. *Sa* appears most commonly in diabetic foot ulcers.
	- Polymicrobial biofilms downregulate IL-1b and TNF-a *in-vivo*. The result is anti-inflammatory.

*rhlABC* will be rescreened as per Deb's thesis.

*"Nature" of publications*
Many read like wiki pages from something like Dustloop. The more substantial publications are like Character guides.

*Thoughts for a review*
I'd like to *try* writing something substantial but the most recent review on my subject is only 2-years-old. A review does exist for agar-plate based macrostructure but little on the meanings of the isolated forms.
