*MHQ*
Another story worth pursuing. Don't bother with the RNAseq and tn-seq. Be conservative with MHQ.

*Biofilm heterogeneity*
Daniel approves the current plan!
(A) Complete the *Sa* screen (BF acceptable)
- (A.1) Look at *flg* mechanisms during biofilm development
- (A.2) Look at PAO1, PA14, LESB58 growth rate in 2x salt media (maybe *opmD* too)
- (A.3) *pqs* - follow up with chemical complementation
- (A.4) Inoculum ratio is a worthwhile control
(B) Find a behaviour exclusive to the heterogenous biofilms
- (B.1) For the *Sa*-biofilm to *Pa*-cell interactions - Daniel mentioned a collaborator. Filter-sterilizing biofilms may be difficult
Optional:
- (S.1) 3d development of biofilms. Will be the last part of my thesis. Everything else *must* be finished
- (S.2) PA14 sub-story shouldn't be strongly pursued. Links to tendril separation in swarming motility.

*List of curiosities*
- RNAseq and tn-seq data is still interesting. Some signals should point towards an *Sa*-specific nutrient source we could use to preferentially select for *Sa* growth.
- We're missing the *mucB* mutant from our previous screen. Worthwhile investigating.
- Dietrich papers! Worth revisiting.
