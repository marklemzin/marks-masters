*Experimental protocol*
- Peptide sourcing. Sounds like leftover exotoxin and viral capsid chunks. 100uL water per powder sample. Corresponds to a total of 10mg/mL.
- [CoA](https://www.beiresources.org/Catalog/BEIPeptidesandPeptideArrays/NR-53729.aspx#) contains peptide sequences.
- [Peptide charge calculator](https://www.bachem.com/knowledge-center/peptide-calculator/). Use N-terminal H and C-terminal OH.
- [Clinical breakpoints for resistance](https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints). Will be used as an external control. Divyash will need to check papers for PA14-specific values. ChatGPT will be useful.
