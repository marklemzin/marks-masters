*Image analysis*
Looks [complicated](https://www.youtube.com/@CraigDaly/videos). I've played around with threshold functions but they simply create a binary colour scheme. I need intensity to be preserved.
My best attempt is with rolling-ball background removal with radius set to 500px and subsequent contrast adjustment (ctrl+shift+c).

Don't forget Pa4228.

Remember to bring this up with Daniel.

*Lewontin's Genetic Basis of Evolutionary Change*
I'll be wrestling through Lewontin's classic over my lunch breaks.
Pg. 8-9. Formalist discussion of evolution. I wonder if terms like E and E' or underlying parameters can be related. What if laws changed over time (tau) or had a start point (t)?
