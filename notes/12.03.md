*Summary*

Mostly spent the day reconfirming strain details. Sounds like I have the all-clear to make some stocks so I'll spend at least some of the day in the lab tomorrow.

I've got some progress on the TM15/DBO projects. It'd be nice to get them both out of the way before getting knee-deep into confocal technicalities, but I'm not sure if that's possible - so I'll just try and get as much done beforehand.

They test spatial-arrangement/channel importance, by mixing up the whole biofilm then replating. It's kind of insane but also *so smart*. Would love to try something like this... Could we use like in-diffusible antibiotics, to grow the channels? They say that nutrients *don't* enter biofilms by diffusion alone. |

*[Standard assay](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14731271/): Pa PA14 morphology*

Comes from an older paper that looks at pellicle formation. Not sure about why this was cited in the 2013 Dietrich paper, but they grow PA14, and the dPhz mutant, on top of media with Congo Red, a dye that can bind EPS components. Note that pel is needed for colony rugosity (wrinkly-ness).

Media is Tryptone Broth (10 g/L), no added salts but added Congo red (40 ug/mL) and Coomassie brilliant blue (20 ug/mL). Inoculum. 1-5-10 uL droplets. OD600 0.025. 1% agar. Can grow for 7 days.

Idea is to see biomass by what binds Congo red. Darked red means more biofilm production, where pink means less uptake of stain into biofilm and maybe reduced biomass. Should be good to highlight macroscopic features. I like the pictures you can get from this sort of thing a lot!

*Small change to the growth-curve protocol*

Got the request to start at OD0.1. Not a problem at all!

Note that the strains I'm using have changed substantially. Only red for Staph. Green and yellow for Pseudo.

*TM15 cleanup*

I'll need to find the strains of interest here. They'll be some transposon mutants, in stuff that cares about respiration.

Pretty weird that this is no *narL* mutant. This is the sheet that I was using to look for transposon mutants.

It does stuff that controls anaerobiosis, in this case nitrate respiration. It should pop up alongside *anr* and *dnr* ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12073043/).) NUO is the anaerobic NADH-dehydrogenase ([paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7857637/#pone.0244142.ref022).)

Funny thing that *narX* is there and it is the neighbouring gene. Maybe we could use this one as a polar transposon mutant.

The mutant does exist in the PAO1 library, so it's pretty unlikely to be essential.

I'll check the [1018 paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33930077/) tomorrow morning.

*Ramblings. Looks can deceive: do sights and sounds have a function?*

It's a interesting thought. How well does a picture reflect the functionality, be it intentional or otherwise, of what we see?

*Ordering from the microbiology store*
- 12mm by 55mm autoclave tape, 3M
- GBO cuvettes, around $18.04 a tray

*Stylistics*
Lars, or maybe his students have a very funny writing style - phrases like more 'invincible', while inaccurate, convey a very great mood - what is the super-cell? It reads like Nietzsche.

*Hypothesis-directed science*
No no no. What we need is *vibes*-directed science.

*Other lab-directed humour*
- 'Return of the king' - maybe changing movie posters to mark the returning of a member.
- 'Boots with the fur' - dancing during a presentation. High highs and low lows, a high-risk kind of joke... Would drive Daniel insane probs.
