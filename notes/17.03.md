This is the first phase of biofilm formation. Agar pad microcolonies (see 07.03), which offer a pretty sweet single-cell resolution, would be the ideal technique here. We'd need to incubate microscope slides, and use a pretty high magnification lens.
- 'For all experiments, we used a PLAPON 60x phase oil objective (NA = 1.42, WD = 0.15 mm) with double digital magnification.' - surrounding paper
- 'Bacteria were immediately imaged with an inverted Nikon TiE or Ti2 at 37°C for 8 hr. Images were acquired with a 100x oil objective (1.45NA).' - meandering paper

Getting a bit more philosophical, this is kind of a bottom-up technique. It starts from single cells and asks about their interactions, so would be best for an agent-based modelling *post hoc*.

Relevant papers: [Meandering](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31713513/) and [Surrounding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34513736/).

I'm need to read up more on this technique. See 07.03.

*Agar colony imaging*

This cares more about macroscopic trends, so things like macrocolony gradients (O2 diffusion, again see 07.03,) so I guess it'd be better for picking up biofilm maturation.

Live-imaging not required.

- 'We then imaged the resulting colonies using a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany)' - consumer-first paper
- 'For _C_, colonies were examined using a dissecting fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).' - iron-redox-wrinkle paper

This is decidedly macroscopic. It's a top-down technique, that infers single-cell trends from macroscopic imagery, and so needs a more heuristic model. I get to use some cellular automata here.

*Experimental coercion: manufacturing complementation*

Bacterial cells can become complementary, if a function from one that the other is dependent on, is removed. I know I read a paper where this was done for a monomicrobial biofilm, but I can't find it!

![cell-diplomacy](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/home-made-diagrams/17.3%20cell-diplomacy.png)

It'd be neat if we could take one type of interaction, and with a deletion, or something else turn it into another.

*I need to make this better represent the political-compass*

- Mutualism. Cells need their partner to survive. High heterogeneity.
- Antagonism. Both cell types have ways to kill the opposing cell, and have kill-on-sight tendencies. Low heterogeneity.
- Parasitism. One cell needs their partner to survive. See the red queen hypothesis. This forms cellular gradients, with one cell on the inside of the core and the other with access to primary nutrients.
- Predator/prey. Only one cell can kill the other on sight... not sure which papers would have some ideas on these topics? This is kind of like the [Wa-Tor model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFYWzKL1cL0).

Again heterogeneity, my measure of interest, would be taken by measuring border length, and by the actual microcolony location: key thing here is access to nutrients.

The corresponding heuristic model, however, would have to be Schelling's segregation model. There'll be a simpler name for it in the Visions-of-Chaos software, I'll take a look when the time comes to do computational analyses.

*Strain specificity*

The key question for polymicrobial biofilms is: prior exposure. Have some strains had more time or chances to co-evolve with Sa? It's a question of adaptation. Strains that are more dependent, for example, would form more homogenous biofilms. Strains that are less dependent, would form heterogenous biofilms.

*Problems with unimarket ordering*

I keep getting asked for an 'account code', with every single order. There must be a place to write it in besides the order notes - I think there was an entry-port, but it needed a code with more digits! Maybe I'll ask Prasanga about this.

*Confocal access*

One last bureaucratic hurdle, then I'll be clean to receive training. I'm waiting for my 2025 PC2 quiz, the one we do every year - to return to me so I can send it onwards to the confocal centre.
