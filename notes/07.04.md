*Summary*

The fatigue that comes with early Winter is starting to weigh on my conscience. Now's not the time to be lazy with my experiments so I'll start staying in the lab longer for the upcoming weeks.
Projects include:
- TM15 needs to be returned to Sam.
- CFU/mL for Pa/Sa co-culture.
- Microscopy.
And of course, my literature review.

*Graphs, graphs, graphs*

I've replaced my old LESB data with that from this weekend's rescreen. It's marginally prettier but it doesn't *really* matter.

This morning I had a little bit of an argument with Sam. He's obviously right but I think I do have a point for the expected experimental endpoint. He said that he would take technical replicates then doctor the data to remove outliers that are from clumping, which is technically (pun intended) correct. I'm more content to leave the outliers in because they don't occur in wild-type strains and only go to cement the idea that the mutants are fluorescent. I'll see how Daniel reacts.

Sounds like I need to use the average for the growth-curves. Again will check whether Daniel cares (I don't think that it's important.)

Has pretty serious clumping issues but only for the engineered strains.

Note the clumping for LESB again.

Weak-ish signal comparatively.

*Symbolic summary*

[Download the strains spreadsheet](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/experimental-setup/12.03%20strains-for-growth-curves.xlsx). This has each strain's comparative fluorescence strength.

Only new thing here is that of the 'pUCP.lacZ-P.YFP' strains only one has a consistently stronger signal. Kinda weird as I assumed these were isogenic. Maybe I used a higher inoculum.

*[Literature stuff](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-08491-1_15#Abs1)*
Figured I'd go over Daniel's chapter on interspecies interactions.

Cells can interact by diffusible molecules or by direct contact, which allows for adaptation to neighbouring cells.
*Good way of saying that cells form feedback loops.*

*Sa* is a commensal bacterium that can be found in about 30% of people in the anterior nares, throat, or on moist skin. Infections with *Sa* can range from mild superficial skin infections to more severe diseases like pneumonia, bacteraemia, and infective endocarditis.
*Pa* in contrast is an environmental generalist that can be associated with water sources, plants, and animals. Like *Sa*, *Pa* is also an opportunistic pathogen. *Pa* can range from unintrusive infections of the eyes (external otitis), skin (dermatitis, folliculitis, or more severe: burn wounds), to more invasive infections like UTIs (catheter-associated) and pneumonias.
*Could be worth talking about divergent ecologies. Sa has faced more antimicrobial pressure where Pa has done... evolution? Pa in the environment too.*

*Sa* and *Pa* coinfections are canonically associated with two diseases: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Chronic Wounds. Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder where the *cftr* (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein is disrupted which leads to a thickening of pulmonary mucous. Loss of regular clearance of pulmonary mucous leads to a static environment that is conducive to bacterial growth.
Chronic wounds are more varied in their pathologies but broadly can be thought of as any wound does not heal readily or follow a predictable structure.
*Would be nice to expand into theories of pathology: wound healing succession and CF immunology.*

Although it has been well-established that bacterial cells can be the force behind some diseases, the broader aspect of poly-microbial interactions has remained underexplored and focus has instead been put on treating individual species. Focus on how poly-microbial interactions in disease (oral cavity, abscesses, otitis media, etc.) have been brought to attention comparatively recently.

CF functions as an enabling factor for *Sa* and *Pa* co-infections by forming a comparatively chaotic environment. Other diseases of the airways: asthma, bronchiectasis, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and URT infections (Rhinosinusitis, ear infections) parallel the loss of regular homeostatic function in CF, but CF is one of the better studied models for chronic infections - perhaps because it is not currently treatable. Studies of CF have followed patients from childhood to adulthood and found trends in bacterial successions. Early infections are known to be associated with *Sa* (60% prevalence in children <2, up to 80% in teens 11-17) and later infections are known to be colonized by *Pa* (70% prevalence in adults 35-44). The *Sa* to *Pa* succession is incomplete, however. *Pa* does not replace *Sa* in older patients completely.

*CF is a strange infection model because of the life-long infections it presents. Long-term infections are easier to analyse than short-term infections.*
*Which factors could lead to such long-term infections are - known...?*

Prognosis of CF infections with *Pa* is worse than for *Sa*. Only a few variants of *Sa*: small-colony variants (SCV) and methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) which are both adapted to infections are known to cause disease directly. The role for *Sa* could extend beyond that of direct antagonism. Current perspectives often take the perspective of the host. Methicillin-susceptible *Sa* (MSSA) has been found to be negatively associated with *Pa*, but whether MSSA blocks *Pa* infections is unclear. Anti-staphylococcal treatments with cephalexin can increase *Pa* colonization, but the clinical effects are uncertain. As an aside, long-term treatments with antibiotics can result in the emergence of pathogenic isolates - treatment is favourable only when clearance is rapid.

*Clinical Sa antagonism*

A case could also be made for *Sa* and *Pa* co-operation. Studies have found that 8.6%-60% of CF patients are co-colonized with *Sa* and *Pa*. Studies of virulence in animal, insect, and *in-vitro* models have found that co-localized *Sa* and *Pa* have increased virulence. Results that would suggest *Pa* and *Sa* co-operation are frequently contradictory.

Table of clinical studies. Contentious.

*6-well plate specifications*
[Eppendorf's plates have a thickness of 1.4mm](https://www.eppendorf.com/product-media/doc/en/90656/Eppendorf_Consumables_Technical-data_Cell-Culture-Plate-6-Well.pdf)
Which seems acceptable.

The inverted microscope we have has 3 objectives:
- [10x](https://www.microscopeworld.com/p-1887-ccis-plan-phase-10x-microscope-objective-lens.aspx) which has a WD of 4.1mm.
- [20x](https://www.motic-microscope.com/p-1898-ccis-plan-phase-lwd-20x-inverted-microscope-objective-lens.aspx) which has a WD of 4.7mm.
- [4x](https://www.microscopeworld.com/p-1886-ccis-plan-phase-4x-microscope-objective-lens.aspx) which has a WD of 12.6mm.

All 3 should be suitable for imaging but I feel as though the best odds are with the 4x.
