*Graphs, graphs, graphs*

I've replaced my old LESB data with that from this weekend's rescreen. It's marginally prettier but it doesn't *really* matter.

This morning I had a little bit of an argument with Sam. He's obviously right but I think I do have a point for the expected experimental endpoint. He said that he would take technical replicates then doctor the data to remove outliers that are from clumping, which is technically correct. I'm more content to leave the outliers in because they don't occur in wild-type strains and only go to cement the idea that the mutants are fluorescent. I'll see how Daniel reacts.

Sounds like I need to use the average for the growth-curves. Again will check whether Daniel cares (I don't think that it's important.)

Has pretty serious clumping issues but only for the engineered strains.

Note the clumping for LESB again.

Clumping ... clumping.

More clumping!

Weak-ish signal comparatively.
