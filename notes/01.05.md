*Swarming stylistics*

I noticed today that *anr* mutants form thinner tendrils than wild-type *Pa*. While strains/mutants may use the same flagellum to move around, it could be that the supporting systems involved in energetics differ. I propose a distinct 'anaerobic' swarming to 'aerobic' swarming. Strains differing in energetic mechanisms could be variably susceptible to TM15.

I could test TM15 against PAO1 and LESB58. Maybe even other bacterial species.

*Salt crystals*
Salt! I thought the black dots inside my media were bacterial inclusions but Sam is probably right in saying they are salt aggregates - they do occur more often in media prone to drying.

*Peptoid super stocktake*

I've braved the cold hell. Here are my results.

I agree with Daniel mostly. Some errors in interpretation of handwriting on both our parts.
What was lost has been found! I will rescreen both TM16 and TM11.

*Rhamnolipids*
We want the final steps of rhamnolipid synthesis inhibited. [Mutants in *rhlABC* seem most appropriate](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002530000443).

For PA14:

| Name   | Plate             | Coordinate | Plate position          |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| *rhlA* | PAMr_nr_mas_01_01 | D5         | Rack 1: Column 1, row 1 |
| *rhlB* | PAMr_nr_mas_14_4  | H8         | Rack 1: Column 5, row 6 |
| *rhlC* | Missing!          |            |                         |

For PAO1:

| Name   | Plate      | Coordinate | Plate position          | Transposon type |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| *rhlA* | phoAwp07q2 | E08        | Rack 2: Column 1, row 5 | phoA            |
| *rhlB* | phoAwp04q2 | F05        | Rack 1: Column 7, row 8 | phoA            |
| *rhlC* | phoAwp05q1 | H04        | Rack 1: Column7, row 11 | phoA            |

PAO1 will have to do.

*Peptoid concentrations*

A205

| PBS (Blank) | 1     | 4     | 6     | 12    | 13    | 14    | 15    | 17    | 18    | 19    | 20    | 22    |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| mg/mL       | 0.188 | 0.129 | 0.035 | 0.138 | 0.186 | 0.155 | 0.112 | 0.12  | 0.207 | 0.111 | 0.119 | 0.140 |
| A280        | -0.08 | 0.02  | 0.01  | 0.02  | 0.01  | 0.03  | -0.01 | -0.01 | -0.05 | 0.00  | 0.00  | -0.01 |

Measurements at A280 are inconsistent and hover around 0.02mg/mL. My stocks should average around 0.1mg/mL. Most hover around TM15's 0.112 (which is actually lower than the average) so the screen is 'fair' relative to TM15.
