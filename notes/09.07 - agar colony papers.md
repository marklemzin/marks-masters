Merging vs. repulsion of *S. typhimurium*, *P. haloplanktis*, *B. subtilis*, and *E. coli*. 'Sociobiology' has been used to describe inter-bacterial signalling *and* collective behaviour. The authors split the paper based on sections of a growth-curve:
- Lag-phase. More nutrients paradoxically increases the time before equilibria is reached. The equilibrium point is steady colony expansion (rather than accelerating).
- Expansion. Less favourable conditions: lower temperatures and less nutrients decreases the top speed reached by expanding colonies. A 'Fisher-Kolmogorov' equation for expansion of the front is mentioned.
- Fast/slow distribution. The bacterial front is 'fast' at the edge of expanding colonies & more 'fast' colonies exist under nutrient-rich conditions. The logical conclusion is that more 'fast' cells are at the edge of expanding colonies.
- Nutrient thresholds. [Diffusible nutrients can be sucked up by rapidly expanding colonies to create 'dead zones' which prevent further expansion.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2718178/#fig3) Dead zones are more rapidly created inbetween independent expanding colonies. Colonies do not crash into one another.
An unusual thought from this paper, the authors mention flagellar dilution in rapidly dividing cells.
Also, dendritic structures form when a geographic bottleneck prevents access of particles in Brownian motion into an otherwise colonizable location.
