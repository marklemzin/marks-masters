*Summary*

Approaching the finishing-line, at least for getting some semblance of a plan. I'll finish my brief genetic outline, then write a little about image analysis. There's only really 3 important points: the first is that biofilms can be heterogenous differently, the second that it's really a large jump to go from feedback loops in theory to visualizing heterogeneity, and then some contingency plans: for when things inevitably go wrong.

And then one final section - where I discuss the only topic I've systematically avoided: cell death as a factor in biofilm development.

Bringing everything together, biofilms can be thought of as many multigenic feedback loops, which are under control of a their spatial localization. Distance in a biofilm can be thought to be relative, with genes having a function based on which gene functions are found in the same locale. With this we can start guessing which genes are in certain types of ecological relationships, and subsequently, how a gene can be visualized 'macroscopically.'

**Mutualism**

Where species exchange exotic functionalities. Think of this as the evolutionary middle ground. Species must make products that are like each other enough that they are mutually recognizable, but not like each other enough that they become commodities. A great example is the extracellular matrix. Both *Pa* and *Sa* are evolutionarily distant, but they both use a biofilm as part of their lifestyle. The reasons that both exist may be evolutionarily divergent (as an example, the *Sa* biofilm is geared to towards infections possibly, and the *Pa* biofilm is better in more situations, maybe) but both are like each other enough that they can form a synergistic matrix.

I think genes that make similar products (like the EPS) are likely to be involved in mutualism. A brief search of polymicrobial interactions, or parallels between monomicrobial biofilms, should be good to locate more possible mutants to investigate.

'Genetic crop circles'

'Like a bubble that pops at the seams - and reveals a hexagon underneath'
'The skeleton of liquids'

- Hexagonal = 2-dimensional icosahedron. The most stable shape besides a circle - one made of discreet elements.

Suggests a single genetic switch, rather than a response to a hormone (would be perfectly circular, maybe?). Rather it's a kind of something that runs through the shape's origin.

- Nutrient limitation. Sam says that this could result in the formation of 'trenches' (I call the depressions 'nodes.')
- Quorum sensation.
