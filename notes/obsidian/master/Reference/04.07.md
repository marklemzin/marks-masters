*ABM or cell automata?*
We have no information about entities implicit in our dataset. At no point do we actively measure bacterial expansions velocities. I find cellular automata a more appropriate tool. The main reason being, that pixels are non-inclusive. A pixel has a definite state.

Pixel images are more complicated than a "ppp" object. "ppp" objects simply state the locations of states. Pixel images have implicit values associated with each location.
