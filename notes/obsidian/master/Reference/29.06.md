*Re-interpreting Prasanga's Sa protocol*
I'm a little confused about the units Prasanga uses in her protocol. Here's a 'translated' version.

All performed on ice. Centrifugation at 4C.
Stuff you need: 10% glycerol (make a 50% stock and dilute down with mqH2O) and 15% sucrose (similar enough, make a 50% stock and dilute down).

1. Spin down cells in **50mL falcon tubes** and resuspend in ice-cold water. 7000g for 5 minutes for the initial centrifugation. 5000g subsequently. Repeat twice for washing.
2. Repeat washing with **10% glycerol** at 1/5 the volume. For example - 800uL for 4mL of ON culture.
3. The third and final wash step uses 1/200 the volume of **10% glycerol**. For example - 20uL for 4mL of ON culture.
4. Electroporation: cells must be spun down and resuspended. Add 80uL of 10% glycerol and 80uL of 500mM sucrose (160uL total, I'm assuming).
500mM sucrose is equivalent to 17% sucrose solution. I'll go with 15% for simplicity.
5. Around 0.5-1ug of pDNA is desirable. Up to 10uL total.
6. Electroporate at RT. 2100V.
7. Cool-down phase is for 1 hour in BHI. I'm not entirely sure about the relevance. I'll keep to dYT. The dYT should have around 15% sucrose.

Sucrose can be prepared to obscenely high concentrations. I'll make a 50% stock.
