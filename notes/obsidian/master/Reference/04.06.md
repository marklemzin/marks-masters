*A paper a day!*
- *Pa* exotoxins do not always affect *Sa*. Exceptions include cyanide-resistant quinol oxidase-bearing strains like *S. carnosus* and ETC-absent SCVs. [*Pa* and *Sa* can be cocultured for 24h but the remaining proportion of *Sa* is minimal (forming isolated pockets - enclaves.)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2772425/) The remaining *Sa* cells have a smaller colony morphology. *Sa hemB* mutants are capable of coculture with *Pa*.
Could be worth taking photos of variable *Sa* colony morphologies from CFU plates - to demonstrate SCV selection. Maybe I can somehow force *Sa* SCV formation (mimicking *hemB*-KO)... or just force myself to use *Sa* SCV mutants.

*Conceptualizing a literature review*
I'd like to immediately integrate Deb's data into the literature. My 'economic' model of exo-molecules should easily characterize economic categories. I just need a couple more papers to begin!
