*Presentation notes:*
Colony biofilms assay structure. Biofilm structure is a complex phenotype existing at the intersect between genetic bacteriology and immunology. Analyses are consequently complicated.

| PA4994     | ~10-fold increase in *Sa* after 8h | 16h eradication                    |
| PA14_71780 | ~10-fold increase in *Sa* after 8h | 16h eradication                    |
| *pqsABC*   | Stable coculture for 10h           | Stable coculture for multiple days |
| *metX*     | Stable coculture for 10h           | 16h eradication                    |

| *ilvC*     | Stable coculture for 10h           | 16h eradication                    |
| *tle1*     | Stable coculture for 10h           | 16h eradication                    |
| *lbcA*     | Stable coculture for 10h           | 16h eradication                    |
| *thiC*     | Stable coculture for 10h           | 16h eradication                    |
| PA1821     | Stable coculture for 10h           | 16h eradication                    |
Notes:
- *pqsABC* - MHQ appears to *increase* coculture potential - especially at higher doses (250-500ug/mL). [MHQ is related to HHQ.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7949062/)
I've actually already assayed all of these mutants.

Sa

| Gene                   | Reported result         | My result   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| *clpP*                 | Increased *Sa*          | -           |
| *pstA*                 | Increased *Sa*          | Need mutant |
| *pknB*                 | Increased *Sa*          | Need mutant |
| *nirD*                 | Increased *Sa*          | Need mutant |
| *hemB*                 | Decreased *Pa*          | -           |
| SAUSA300_0576 (*merA*) | Strongly decreased *Pa* | -           |
Some other hits too, but none are substantially strong.

Notes;
- States that decrease *Pa* growth are plausibly improving *Sa*'s capacity to compete for nutrients or preventing death from *Pa* toxins.
