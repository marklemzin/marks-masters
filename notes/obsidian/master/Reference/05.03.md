*Summary*

My study was cut short by my laptop charger breaking down today - it almost gave me an aneurysm, thinking that my laptop had broken entirely. Thankfully not.

I got in contact with the confocal team, but they need me to send them my training records for PC2 conditions. I asked Megan, but she only sent me my marked health and safety quiz from last year - maybe it will be enough?

*What do I care about in this project?*
I guess it's really about flexing my brain a little on some biogeography. There's two big questions here that have a lot of angles from which they could be approached.

(A) What makes Pa and Sa form large microcolonies, as in monomicrobial bubbles, within a biofilm? Could it be a nutrient source, for example, a lower O2 concentration, that opens a niche for one species but not the other? This question is about *where* a species is found and how *big* it can grow in that location.

(B) What makes Pa and Sa microcolonies, have a shape? This is asking more about interspecies interactions, like how it could be better for Sa to have shorter colony borders, in order to reduce the area which Pa could colonize Sa. What about trade-offs? A smaller border would mean that there would be less area for accessing nutrients.

(C?) What if I could combine questions A and B? I could say that there are certain locations, be they environmental/bacterial-proximity, that can change the relation between colony-size/border-shape.

I spoke to Daniel, briefly, but he seems to be on-board with question B. He gave me the name of a person that works on this kind of thing: Lars Dietrich. I'll take a look at his work today! It looks very interesting.

*Deb review, continued*
Making better models with RNA-Seq. A paper found that SCFM2, a media that mimics CF sputum, goes far to making Pa behave as it would in a CF lung, but that it has some changes in porin/polyamine expression. One of the better models is the murine pneumonia model.

There are some changes between the CF lung/chronic wound environments. One change is that one is more alkaline, the wound environment. The media to mimic the chronic wound is part of the Lubbock Chronic Wound Biofilm (LCWB) model. It uses plasma and some damaged cells. We have access to an in-vivo abscess model that does not require manual wounding by using dense inoculums, of Pa LESB58 or Sa LAC USA300, to infect mice subcutaneously. I guess that the bugs do all the heavy lifting to create a scabbed/nasty wound.

Biofilms provide a zone of respite from the stress of antibiotic treatment. The chronic wound model given above - LCWB, can increase Sa antibiotic tolerance, which growth with Pa can further potentiate. This has been linked to the biofilm constituents, like Pa alginate. Pa also seems to increase Sa *tet38* expression, which confers both tetracycline tolerance, and Sa internalization (by binding CD36 of A549 cells).

HQNO, a Pa siderophore, can block the ETC of Sa. This reduces the Sa membrane gradient, which can disrupt cell intake of tetracyclines. A slowed metabolism, something like a stagnant economy, slows cell replication. This can increase some antibiotic tolerances, such as to b-lactams, which can only kill replicating cells. 

There is binding between Sa SpA / Pa Psl. The aggregation, as in between Sa and Pa cells in the bacterial biofilm, can increase Sa tobramycin tolerance. Yet rhamnolipids, a Pa biosurfactant, can also disrupt the Sa cell membrane, leading to increased tobramycin uptake. It's neat that a Pa knockout for rhamnolipid production, could confer full tobramycin resistance, to Sa.

*Heterogeneity evidence*
Do Sa and Pa form monomicrobial bubbles, or enclaves? I think the orthodoxy was heterogeneity, but in many pictures I've seen in papers have very homogenous colonies. Some [papers](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00047-21 ) still show heterogeneity though.

*Ramblings*
How would you disrupt a mature ecosystem? Would we start with the late colonizers, like large trees - or instead focus on the early colonizers, like shrubs and lichens? It depends on the change we'd want to make to the ecosystem.
