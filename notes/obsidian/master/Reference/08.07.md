*opmD*
Looks like deletion of *opmD* is fatal to *Pa* growing with *Sa*. Given the linkage to *pqs*, my suspicion is that pathway occurs inthisway.
- *opmD* is part of MexEF-OprN. The pump is associated with export of PQS metabolites (HHQ).
- My colonies grow as being especially green. Suggests some kind of dysregulation of siderophores.
Daniel suggested looking for metabolites that could be exported *via* *opmD*.
- Knockout disrupts *pqs*-associated functions: pyocyanin, elastase (*lasB*) and biofilm-formation genes.
- Overexpression and under-expression of *opmD* is common in late-stage clinical isolates ('adapted' strains).

A reply! I've organized a meeting. Hopefully Hamish can suggest a non-retiring mentor. Perhaps an overseas connection.
