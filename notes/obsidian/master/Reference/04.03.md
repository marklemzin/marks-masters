*Summary*

Felt like I spent too much time getting through [Deb's review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33576132/). It seems pretty complete for when it was published, but it hasn't given me any new ideas for biofilm modelling.

I *really really need* to get onto just getting in touch with the confocal team. They might be able to help with experimental design.

Sam brought up goal-setting. I guess it's never too early to start so I guess my end goal would be to show a trade-off between microcolony size, and microcolony topology. There isn't a molecular motivation, but it's not a bad question from an ecological standpoint.
*After* finding this trade-off I can extrapolate, and show how this trade-off can be changed with mutants or other strains or stressors or antibiotics.

*Queries for the confocal team*
- How close can we see? The images taken in many papers are still very distant from bacteria, no more than a few pixels per bacterial cell.
- Is it possible to take a time-series? This would require a microscope incubator, and that it's alright to work with live PC2 organisms.

*'Microslides'*
They aren't really microscope slides. They're a lot more like 4-well plates, except that they're made of glass and are very expensive.

*Coculture substrate*
- Trans-well filters. These seem to crop up quite often - maybe someone in our lab knows about them? I could use a known coculture method, then adapt it to include trans-wells. The only thing is whether the plastics are good for biofilm formation.

*Trick of the light: are cells dead or alive?*
I'm not sure if presence of GFP/mCherry, or any other fluorescent reporter, is enough to say that a cell is viable. A protein can be produced, then stay stable even in non-viable cells. Note that viability, and metabolic function, are not equivalent. It would be ideal to somehow measure both - to avoid confounding. It could be that dormant cells will not show up on the confocal images.

*More on biofilm homo/heterogeneity*
It seems fine to assume that species in well-mixed biofilms, as opposed to heterogenous communities, will have at least a neutral relationship. But telling between communal cooperation, and communal tolerance, is not something immediately apparent. Perhaps there may be distinct ways that biofilms can be homogenous.

*Deb's review*
This is a very information-dense paper. Instead of my usual brief notes I'll write an extended summary. I'll rewrite this and add some new reading to make a decent part of my introduction.

Introduction. The old idea is that of successions, where Sa may predominate earlier, but later be overtaken by Pa. For example, a child with cystic fibrosis, a disease that thickens the lung's mucosal layer, will have an Sa-dominant infection, but this progresses to Pa-dominant. However, both Sa and Pa can be co-isolated (an incomplete succession) from some adult CF patients.

Sa tends to be found at the top layer of chronic wounds where Pa is found deeper in the wound bed - this is reversed, when looking at the liquid culture laboratory model. Pa forms a biofilm at the air-liquid interface (pellicle), Sa settles at the bottom of the well - the opposite situation.

Are there really issues with flow-cell models? Mushroom-shaped biofilms sounds like a pretty neat thing to study whether it's biologically relevant or not.

PQS system (HQNO). HQNO, Pa's quorum sensing molecule, induces Sa small colony variant (SCV) formation, via the electron transport chain (ETC). Pa pyocyanin, lasA protease, and rhamnolipids, all can mess with Sa biofilm formation. Sa components, I.E., the cell wall's GlcNAc, can cause Pa to inhibit Sa more, like by increasing ClpXP production. Research here has been variably effective, as the view that mucoidy (alginate overproduction) is all that is needed to outcompete Sa, has been questioned with one study finding that it was not a predicting factor, at least in clinical isolates.

Crossfeeding. Pa can shift Sa to a fermentation metabolism, in a bronchial-cell model, and use the consume the resulting lactate (a viable carbon source). In early coculture, Sa has more active rep. machinery, as perhaps it is at an advantage. But Pa may later dampen Sa replication, in an almost parasitic manoeuvre, not to kill it entirely, but rather to keep it as auxiliary nutrients. Like cattle bred for meat - Sa is kept to be repressed. *Staphylococci of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your Pseudomonads.*
Coincidentally, many of the genes needed by Sa in an in-vivo infection model, are those needed for metabolism. The presence (?) of Sa can also reduce the metabolism of Pa.

Adaptation. Early Pa isolates, taken a few weeks after infection, differ from later Pa clones - from the same patient background. They have more biofilm and planktonic Sa repressive capacity.

But Pa can cooperate. One way is via alginate, a biofilm constituent, again coincidentally, greatly made by late-stage Pa isolates. Another is by getting rid of quorum sensing machinery, which controls many virulence factors, perhaps some of which can kill Sa.

Biofilm builders: biofilm architecture. This can change with oxygen, pH, and antibiotic treatment. Vancomycin, for example, causes Sa to shift proximally (centrally). Some part of Sa supernatant, a solution made up of extracellular protein, can promote Pa motility. Some Sa glycoproteins, found in the membrane normally, can bind to Pa's membrane proteins. This allows either Sa to bind to Pa as it travels - a kind of molecular hitch-hiking, or allows Pa to bind to Sa and form biofilms during early stages of infection.

Immune interactions. Pa kills Sa 'off the epithelial cell', it does this by making a toxin ExoS, that causes cells to make the phospholipase sPLA2-IIA, which in turn eliminates Sa. Pa can cause expression of surface proteins needed for Sa colonization (ICAM-1, ITGA-5).

Host responses. There is little O2 in the lungs of CF patients. Low O2 is known to reduce Pa virulence. Pa can cause an over-reactive immune response that makes clearance of bacteria worse, meaning that Sa can survive better.

Host-mimicking experiments. It looks like host-like media such as DMEM, used for cell culture normally, can form more robust biofilms to nutrient-rich media. Pre-establishment. Sa biofilms can be matured in advance before Pa inoculation.


*Loose thoughts*
Addition of a transcript/molecule, that negates a desirable effect. For example, ctrl + s, on a keyboard is a useful shortcut to save documents. Ctrl + shift + s, however, while still saving documents, has a very different function. Could I use this to explain an ecological relationship, somehow?

...

How well can micro-colonies survive, if they are covered in macro-colonies, and if the species relations are not neutral? It could be the case that there is an equilibrium, where further colonization, be it from the smaller or larger colony, is not longer a possibility. I'm not sure whether anything is ever to small to be overlooked, at least in the bacterial world. Even a couple of cells together could pose an ecological threat, to for example, an uninvaded culture.

...

I think the question in ecology, more than any other discipline, is how complex relations between species can possibly be. It's a question of resolution. Simpler species-species relations shouldn't need a complex model (be it experimental or theoretical), where complex relationships, need to have both those same simple models - let's say simpler models map energetics, but also need to have their higher-order characteristics described. This could be something like biological memory, where one species may punish another for a previous infraction, perhaps of some unwritten biological law, as often shown in mathematical game theory.

But the question really is: how complex are Sa and Pa relations? It's more than a mere mutual ignorance, as shown by studies resolving links between them both at the molecular level, but are these evolutionarily intentional, or simply a by-product of Pa or Sa having a flexible design?

...

Behavioural imprinting. Can one species acting in one way make another species act like it? It's kind of like a bunch of people dancing - it may be weird to join in if taken in isolation, but it seems normal if other people are enjoying themselves.

....

Risk // reward. Does game theory biology, or any field have a way of seeing how much of a high risk decision, given an invaluable reward, something would take?
