*Summary*

Data looks good use in a presentation, but could use a bit of work on embellishment. I need to get a plan out to Daniel asap.

*Graphs from fpscreen (29.3-31.3)*

I need to clean up the code and raw data so that they're both a little more interpretable. Key thing is to make sure that *Sa* cultures are labelled for TSB (Tryptic Soy Broth). For now however, the graphs made are serviceable.

It'd be nice to expand into the dotplots as well but I'm not sure how to keep data all on the same graph!

*Graphs: unrefined*

I have more graphs of single strains in my [graph bank](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/tree/main/graphs), all are dated with '31.3'.

Growth curve culture:
- *Sa* was always grown in TSB
- *Pa* was always grown in LB

Some errors:
- Names of strains can go out of plot window - no easy fix :(
- Getting stats to align properly
- Could add stats to plots with all *Pa* strains but that's kind of a pain - would be easier to facet plots together.

Looks like LESB grows slower than PAO1 and PA14. Weird that PA14 grows a little slower than PAO1.

Growth of USA300 is consistent.

No hits for the PAO1 pUC-mini-P1-GFP strains, which must be the ones with transposon insertions. A shame as it would have been good to use it due the genetic stability.

![fpscreen-ALL-yfp](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/graphs/31.3%20fpscreen-ALL-yfp.png)

For the YFP spectra, it's weird to see that it hits GFP so well. I saw this in my preliminary screen too. It doesn't matter so long as we don't plan on using GFP/YFP in one experiment. Not too sure what these 'pUCP.lacZ-Pro-YFP' strains are.

![fpscreen-USA300-FarRed](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/graphs/31.3%20fpscreen-USA300-FarRed.png)

Cool that I hit FarRed the first time. Looks like a big difference.

Moving forward:
- GFP has much stronger emission than YFP. I'll stick to the GFP strains for *Pa* for now.
- I need to test *Sa* growth/fluorescence in LB, maybe in parallel with my *Pa* strains.
- I need to test whether 592/650 can hit GFP in *Pa*, and whether 480/515 can hit FarRed in *Sa*.

*Hexcodes for use in ggplot*

I've made a small list of hexcodes that I'll be using for colours in this project - I'll keep it minimalistic. Each colour represents a fluorescent protein.
