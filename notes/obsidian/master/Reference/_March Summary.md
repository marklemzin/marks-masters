*Brainstorm*

*Editor's (a retrospective Mark) comments: this is a bunch of mis-matching thoughts that I've assembled into some patchwork theory. My 'technique' for coming up with something to do starts by taking a simple concept and bringing it out to an absurd conclusion. I begin with a concept of cellular heterogeneity and extend it out to predicting biofilm functions. The relevant experimental material will be kept in the experimental plan above. I don't feel that what follows is important enough to be read in detail, but if you are interested in the reason behind my choices, I think what follows covers my perspective well. I hope it will help me handle upcoming experiments well.*

*Sa is an abbreviation for Staphylococcus aureus. Pa is an abbreviation for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.*

Within the same prokaryotic cell gene products cannot always touch one another and 'signalling cascades' can be spatially limited. The same idea applies at a macromolecular level where gene products cannot always freely travel in-between cells. It follows that cell-to-cell interactions (such as those found in a biofilm environment) could also be dependent on space: how close and how far cells are, from one species to the other, can affect trans-cellular signalling.

In such an ecological model it is impossible to think of biofilms as a uniform macro-organism. When we ignore spatial dynamics it is normal to think of biofilms as an ecological 'black box.' There are inputs and outputs like an enzymatic machine (in go nutrients, out goes biomass) which change along an ecological gradient. Biofilms may act as a well-oiled machine, and with a certain Darwinian optimism may even be thought to be on a trajectory (evolutionary) towards acting energetically optimally. But are there alternative perspectives, perhaps?

I propose that in a complex ecological model that there can be pockets of evolutionary stagnation. Imagine that a cell enters an equilibrium with another. The participating genes coevolve and both sides gain an optimized function. But there is a cost, as this novel function becomes situational; a function that is active only when the gene product is in proximity to its partner. Such a specialization can with even a slight change in the host cell's surroundings become evolutionarily backwards.

The nature of adaptation over time however is not a core component of ecology. What is instead relevant is how cells behave when they *sense* their environment. Instead of thinking about evolutionary trajectories we can think of expansionist phenotypes. Instead of thinking about evolutionary checkmates we can think of interspecies equilibria. And genes don't need to 'co-adapt' to have spatially-restricted behaviour. Cells have never feasibly evolved in isolation. They are well-adapted to both the current environment of the Earth and to the cells that coinhabit the Earth. So I do not feel that it is a coincidence or some evolutionary fate that two partner species will almost always have some degree of genetically-driven interaction.

Let me take a step back again - cells can be thought of as a unification of genes. Isn't it strange that genes are split across many different species when they could be part of a greater super-organism? That parts of the genes, like parts of a greater evolutionary machine are strewn between cells,, when they could be part of a single being? Such a thought is not entirely a fantasy. Genes can be producers of many metabolites or other extracellular particle, which have a role beyond the cell's barrier-like membrane.

*A thought for Sam. Can we think of cells as being assembled from pre-determined-genes like how we know the pool of cards in a rogue-like game? Do genes exist before they are made?*

Cells - crucially need at least two distinct functions (as opposed to only 1 essential function, when taking an evolutionary perspective) to participate in ecological interaction:
(1) a consumer module: a gene product that can respond to extracellular stimuli.
(2) a producer module: a gene product that can change the cell's extracellular environment.
These form the genes needed to create either a positive feedback loop (like a signalling cascade) or a negative feedback loop (I think of it as an equilibrium) in response to an environmental stimuli. The consumer module ('conmod') is there to turn extracellular signals into intracellular cues which the producer module ('prodmod') can perform a response towards.

There is nothing intrinsically ecological about polymicrobial biofilms. Just as well as a a single cell can form a feedback loop so can another species and so can two species form an interconnected loop. With two species I can think of 4 ecological trajectories. For now imagine that cells are simple 'minimum ecological constructs' (MECs; I made this up for convenience) with only one conmod (consumer module) and prodmod (producer module). The conmod is wired to activate the prodmod, which goes on to manipulate extracellular space.

Let's say that two MECs have a matching conmod and prodmod, that they are ecologically indiscriminable. Both MECs respond to the same regulatory signal and both produce a signal that they are both responsive towards. If the background of such MECs is essentially isogenic and both MECs start in equal numbers then neither should overgrow the other. But with even a slight population perturbation one species will begin to overgrow the other. Such a dynamic (between two MECs) is balanced on a single chaotic point which can tip the scales in favour of one MEC like a see-saw carrying slippery weights.

Two identical MECs (conmod/prodmod) have a network that connects cells together I.E. there are matching conmods and prodmods. But as both MECs produce the same product neither MEC has an incentive to cooperate. MECs that are exact opposites (no matching modules) are also insufficient for cooperation. As prodmods and conmods become too different there is less reason for MECs to interact at all. Such MECs have no shared signal so cannot value partner MECs for more than their material components.

Suppose instead there are two MECs but each have a set of mismatching conmods/prodmods. Each conmod/prodmod pair is responsive only to a prodmod product from the partner MEC. Such MECs find a middle ground where signals are distinguishable but also valuable to partners (like an exotic trade good.) Neither MEC can outgrow its partner until the partner's product loses value - such as by finding an environmental nutrient source. It's curious perhaps that such states of 'genetic disorder' are statistically more probable (at least more so than MECs which have only matching conmods and prodmods) so long as modules are free to be distributed between MECs. It's like how two liquids will tend towards perfect heterogeneity when mixed.

But what if such a signal trade is not bilateral but rather only one-directional? Here MECs must be asymmetrically constructed. One MEC takes the role of an independent producer and the 'parasite' MEC leeches products without any kind of reciprocation. Such a system is stable so long as the 'producer' MEC does not outcompete the 'parasite' MEC. Signal trading occurs on a gradient and how much one species receives for how little it invests determines its status, either as a parasite or as a mutualist.

*Types of feedback loops with two participants. From top to bottom **(A) Indiscriminate equilibrium.** Species are ecologically isogenic, and will overgrow each other when given a growth advantage. **(B) Discriminate gradient.** Species have an asymmetrical gene arrangement, and become hierarchically-dependent. Stable so long as the 'producer' cannot outgrow the 'parasite' species. **(C) Discriminate equilibrium.** Species are mutualistic. Growth cannot be easily decoupled, unless trans-cellular goods lose trade value between organisms. **(D) Indiscriminate gradient.** Cells do not directly interact. Growth is necessarily decoupled.*

*Editor's comments: I've used a couple of terms here that I haven't described elsewhere: 'discriminate/indiscriminate' and 'equilibrium/gradient.' What I mean by 'discrimination' is whether growth of one species is directly coupled to the other. What I mean by 'gradient/equilibrium' is the direction of interaction, whether it is unilateral (a gradient) or bilateral (an equilibrium.)*

Let's forget about MECs (minimal ecological constructs) and return to cells and genes - more familiar concepts. Cells can be thought of as collections of MECs. I believe that every species of cell can form multifaceted relationships. Some parts could lead to fatal interactions where other parts are necessarily mutualistic.

Let's take another step back. In a lab-cultured biofilm environment (agar-plate colony) there are distinct stages in biofilm development: reversible attachment, irreversible attachment, maturation, and dissipation. During this time it well-understood that there is a kind of ecological succession where *Pa* comes to predominate *Sa*. It makes sense that besides species ratios there could be a change in *Pa* and *Sa*'s spatial distribution. As far as I'm aware, an 'ecological perspective' hasn't been much explored in biofilm development, less so in polymicrobial settings, and not at all for *Pa* and *Sa*.

During early stages of biofilm development cells are known to use motility systems such as the flagellum of *Pa* to seek out attachment surfaces. [It's known](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6910820/) that *Pa* can direct itself towards *Sa* by process of chemotaxis and attach to the surface of *Sa* cells. The process is something like how ants can follow a pheromone trail. Pioneer *Pa* cells use a pilus to follow a trail of PSMs (*Sa* surfactants) towards the *Sa* colony. Travel after this point is towards a combination of *Sa* and *Pa*. As an ecological interaction it's unclear whether *Sa* gains something from *Pa*'s sudden proximity but this could not be an indiscriminate relationship as *Pa* does move towards *Sa*. What *Pa*'s ecological incentive is is a more complicated question. In a closed system where *Pa* and *Sa* were perfectly co-evolved and where *Sa* does not regrow, it makes little sense that a motility system would exist if it were used to eradicate *Sa*. *Pa* could feed from *Sa* metabolites, or provide a growth factor for *Sa* in exchange for waste-products, or even cull the *Sa* population for nutrients - but *Pa* should not outright eradicate *Sa* lest the pressure to retain motility is lost. While such a model is unrealistic but it does seem to model early biofilm development as there are perspectives that *Sa* is the keystone species in early biofilms. As the biofilm matures the payoff for *Pa* from keeping *Sa* alive could wane for *Pa* so the growth of *Sa* cells is instead repressed.

The paper in the previous paragraph uses a 2-dimensional experimental model. Some very short glass frames are put onto a sterile microscope slide which is then used to cast a very thin layer of agarose gel that has been spiked with nutrients. A drop of culture is placed onto the gel and then 'sandwiched' with a coverslip slide. The slide is kept in a temperature/humidity controlled microscope for up to 8 hours (in methods that I've encountered.) Using high-resolution light microscopy *Pa* and *Sa* can be told apart by morphology alone (rods/cocci).

At the confocal centre we have access to only one PC2 microscope from what I understood from Rob. The '[Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System](https://www.otago.ac.nz/omni/confocal-microscopy/cm-equipment)' has a growth chamber and is able to be used with PC2 organisms. I was showing the slide model to Rob in the context of the paper above and he's since advised me to use it for agar-plate colonies too. The only trouble is that the system requires the shape of the plate to be explicitly defined or that we use a compatible plate (like a 24-well plate, which is not the same as a microscope slide obviously.)

For more developed biofilms it's better to look at static biofilm colonies. We can use fluorescent strains to highlight the key structures of biofilms. *Pa* could form a structure that encapsulates *Sa* for example. At a macroscopic level biofilms of *B. subtilis* have piles that form tunnels which can transport water, like little microbiological aqueducts. Maybe either *Pa* or *Sa* can be part of a macro-cellular transport network.

*Studies with mutants look at an alternate history where something is not present to create a certain biofilm structure.*

Bringing the previous sections together: biofilms can be thought of as many multigenic feedback loops which have spatially-dependent activity. Distance in a biofilm can be thought to be relative as genes have a function based on which gene functions are found in the same locale. With this we can start guessing which genes are in certain types of ecological relationships and subsequently how a gene can be visualized 'macroscopically.'

**Mutualism**

Where species exchange exotic functionalities. Think of this as the evolutionary middle ground. Species must make products that are like each other enough that they are mutually recognizable but not like each other enough that they become commodities. A great example is the extracellular matrix. Both *Pa* and *Sa* are evolutionarily distant but they both use a biofilm as part of their lifestyle. The reasons that both exist may be evolutionarily divergent (as an example, the *Sa* biofilm is geared to towards infections possibly and the *Pa* biofilm is better in more situations maybe) but both are like each other enough that they can form a synergistic matrix.

I think genes that make similar products (like the EPS) are likely to be involved in mutualism. A brief search of polymicrobial interactions or parallels between monomicrobial biofilms should be good to locate more possible mutants to investigate.

**Parasitism**

Could also be thought of as 'opportunism.' One species provides an exotic function to another but the act is not reciprocated. The 'parasite' (often called a 'cheater') may provide a commodity or even repress growth of the 'producer' cell but the 'parasite' shouldn't overtake the growth of the 'producer' in an ecological vacuum.

In terms of genetic segregation this is an odd case out of my 4 scenarios as it needs species to have an asymmetrical distribution of functionalities. The 'parasite' must explicitly have an functional regulator gene and an *unrelated* producer gene. The 'producer' must have a functional regulator gene and a *related* producer gene.

In biological terms this means that one species must control a common signal which the other species can only ever be modulated by. It's a trans-cellular version of the same genetic circuit that makes intracellular feedback loops possible. We could look at genes found in functions where *Pa* or *Sa* could either sense or produce a response to an oncoming stressor which could affect the partner species to some extent. My first guess is that phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) or any of the *Pa* QS molecules (surfactants mostly but also HQNO) could be a part of a parasitic circuit. Some other gene products to try could be metabolites which are part of a metabolic feedback loop.

*If I had to choose one, I think this one is the most difficult to conceptualize. I'll write about parasitism more later but if a similar pattern occurs at different biological levels (genetic/trans-cellular) I'd guess that cells would be distributed fractally. Think of the 'parasite' like how a fire spreads through a dampened forest or vice-versa.*

**Antagonism**

Where species exchange commodities. Both species behave like cells in a mutualistic relationship but both species produce a signal that is native to all cells anyway. Cells could have to deal with metabolite accumulation (possibly toxic) from both native sources as well as exogenously from the partner cell's metabolism. Evolutionarily speaking the overlap of the *Pa* and *Sa* 'secretomes' would most likely occur at the metabolic level through any of the small-molecule by-products: pH (H+), reduced carbon sources (in an anaerobic biofilm), or reactive-oxygen species.

**Predator/prey**

Where species are so different that they can find no value in the partner species beyond nutritional value. Alternatively where cells must eradicate competition maybe to push a more niche isolationist lifestyle (which cannot tolerate competition.)

At an evolutionary level this occurs when the other ecological strategies (mutualism, parasitism, antagonism) are less valued than partner eradication. How such a barrier could be calculated or even conceptualized is beyond me.

This is what we think of when we talk about canonical polymicrobial interactions. Toxin secretion, contact-dependent killing, or even intrinsic growth advantages; all are ways for cells to get into an antagonistic relationship

The 'prey' to the 'predator' must be so insignificant that it is almost eradicated on accident. We must be very careful to not confuse predator/prey relationships with parasitism. They are not equivalent.

![cell-diplomacy](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/home-made-diagrams/17.3%20cell-diplomacy.png)

*An accidental diagram (hopefully humorous.) I was thinking and playing around with ecological relationships, and they somehow ended up in a grid that resembles the political compass. For context: the left-to-right scale would measure the distribution of capital (socially-distributed to privately-owned) and the top-to-bottom scale would show the distribution of political power (centralized-management to grass-roots management.)*

There is a trend towards measuring colony heterogeneity as a proxy to showing ecological relationships. There's a great list in this review on [detecting heterogeneity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36227846/). My problem with work like this is that, as Sam would say, there is no biological basis. It'd be nice to have a review that gives examples like 'sector width' shows not only 'heterogeneity' but is also a way to show how much cells have grown from a frequently single-celled bottleneck - a representation of colonization potential.

*'Heterogeneity is not homogenous'*

But how could we use a model in a project? Based on our experimental design (agar-plate colonies) our data would be of static ecological settings. We can simulate by means of a mathematical model the biofilm's development *in-silico* - though making comparisons between *in-silico* and *in-vitro* data would need some serious statistical modelling. I prefer to think of models as an art critic would think of brush strokes, that they are part of an irreducible whole. Each model is mathematically chaotic but if we know what rules are behind the shapes formed maybe we can start to guess what genes could be involved when cells combine into similarly-shaped structures.

*An example: interpreting ecological images*

![fractal-mixing](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/pictures/11.3%20fractal-mixing.jpg)


*Centre: initial inoculum. Green: consumer (nar KO). Cyan: producer (nir KO).*

The image above is from [a paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8319339/) that takes a look at the behaviour of 2 complimentary strains lacking either Nar or Nir (genes involved in N reduction) and their distribution on polymicrobial agar-plate colonies.

Their main conclusion: enough of one mutant is enough to determine which direction a metabolic gradient (N reduction) flows over a spatial region. The mutant which is in a higher density in the inoculum will go on to form the outer layer of the bacterial colony. The paper does not explain the fractal distribution of bacteria. This doesn't invalidate their conclusions but it's kind of a shame that they don't go any further with the fractal idea given how eye-catching it is.

Their 'fractal colony arrangement' doesn't remind me so much of a fractal shape as it does a process called diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA). DLA is something I had stumbled upon over the Summer as part of my recreational research and it's nice to see it pop up [in biofilm modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038109810000281) as well as this paper, completely coincidentally.

DLA itself is a pretty simple algorithm. A single point is placed on a toroidal plane (the top of the x-axis is the same as the bottom of the x-axis, and the same for the y-axis) and one-by-one, pixels are spawned at the borders and allowed to walk randomly until they contact a stationary pixel. As more pixels aggregate ('aggregation') their random walk is less likely to reach the core of the aggregated-structure ('diffusion-limited').

Taking a biological perspective we can look at each 'branch' of DLA as if it were made of 2 ecological gradients. The first is the line going out from the core - they explain this as the pressure from growing cells to force each other out towards uncolonized space, and the second line is the one that cells spread out concentrically along, to restrict access to the nucleating cell. This second line is less simple to explain biologically but we could think of it as cells having pressure to form borders with the complimentary strain. The genetic basis for DLA is not explained in the paper. It could be motility, chemotaxis, or just overgrowth but this is not explained by the paper.

![2d-dla](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/home-made-diagrams/28.3%202d-dla.png)

It's a bit strange that DLA could be driven by physical cell interactions entirely (at least when looking at the data presented) since some of the DLA branches begin at the border and extend into the colony's core. Cell-to-cell pushing should only extend outwards from the colony core but it's clear here that DLA can go towards the colony core too.

From an ecological perspective DLA presents a model that maximizes interspecies homogeneity. Only parasitism/mutualism support interspecies mixing. The strains in the paper lend themselves well to a mutualistic model where a single partner cell grows out into a pre-colonized population of partner cells. Two factors predict plot colonization: a plot should be far enough away from the self (for example: no NO2- accumulation) and should be close enough to the other (for example: a partner than can turn NO2- into NO.) Visually and biologically this is much like how *Pseudomonas* cells swarm.

*Editor's notes: A 'plot' in ecology is a colonizable space. Think of it as a 'plot of land'.*

As a thought experiment if we add more and more colonizer cells the biofilm becomes saturated. Each cell has less space to expand freely and so form smaller and smaller DLA structures. When the biofilm is saturated cells cannot undergo DLA-style colonization - since the biofilm is already homogenous.

There is also a case to be made for parasitism. The empty space left in a DLA crystal (occupied by the partner cell) will have a greater total area than the crystal itself. When a species takes up more space than its partner species, the interspecies relationship cannot be perfectly mutualistic. The DLA pattern can suggest that the 'consumer' mutant has a slight edge in growth over the 'producer' despite being almost perfectly isogenic strains - but this is also shown to be strongly related to initial inoculum density.

*An example: Ecological neutrality*

Adapted from [this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32555430/), the bottom of the section titled 'Channels emerge as an inherent property of biofilm formation.'

This paper looks at water channels in *E. coli* colonies. I don't want to write about the rest of the paper as I think it's actually very good, but there is one section that requires care in its interpretation. To look at whether water channels could spontaneously reform, the water channels were mechanically disrupted (using a sterile pipette) after some time and allowed to restructure themselves.

Does such a disruption (mechanical) ever result in an absence of an ecological state, where cells simply cannot react to each other? I'd guess that cells instead become homogenous, and would be forced into a setting where if possible, mutualism/parasitism are the optimal strategies.

It's really a logic of balance: in order to lose an ecological state, biofilms must always gain a replacement state. Certain gene products may have less or more merits to them under such circumstances. For example, a parasite ('cheater') may find themselves pushed to the borders of a producer colony normally, but if the species are intermixed, it could be that the 

When considering antimicrobial treatments, those that disrupt the biofilm do not only remove prior ecological associations, but also provide room for novel functionalities. A niche function of a species may become critically important, if the cell is moved into a sub-optimal place for its main survival strategy.

Ecological neutrality, while plausible, is a transient concept. Cells far apart are ecologically neutral, and cells that are placed in a new environment will quickly adapt. In that small window of time species will behave as before and be acting irrespective of spatial context. *'Cellular globalism.'*
