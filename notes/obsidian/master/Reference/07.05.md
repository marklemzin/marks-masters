*The day in which I encounter problems*
Looks like deletion of anr, dnr, or nuoL is insufficient to restore swarming to TM15-treated cells. The mystery deepens. I messed up my wild-type control for my kdp inhibitory concentration experiments but can follow-up with the same experiment tomorrow. Looks like neither Sam nor me was correct.

*Confocal training*
Lots of information to process. Most important thing is to order some mini-plates. But I'll have enough for the Friday pilot.

*PA14 and PAO1: Deb's data*

The USA300 data looks only partially processed. I'll speak with Daniel about its interpretation (maybe Sam.)

I mentioned that plate-drying was a confounder. My suspicion wasn't unfounded. Here's my analysis:

*PAO1 - proteins of interest (KO improves Sa growth)*

I'm using the string database for basic protein information.
