- Pa0151: structural similarity with *Pa* FpvA-Pvd complex. FpvA 'Ferric Pyoverdine receptor.' [FpvA is critical for growth in iron-limited media and regulates the *pvd* operon involved in siderophore synthesis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC135083/). Structure paper: [FpvA appears to bind iron-free siderophores and ferry iron across the cell membrane](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi700997w).

- Pa0318: appears to be DNA-binding. Various hits from many organisms: human retrotransposon endonucleases, cow DNAse, and *Ec* RssB (regulator of rpoS) CTD. Hits included for fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase - involved in amino-acid catabolism. Ubiquitin-binding proteins in humans too.

- Pa0539: various fatty-acid binding proteins. Could be involved in lipogenesis.

- Pa1629: appears to be recognized as the monomer in trimeric-tetrameric constructs. Structural similarity to DspI (*Pa* PAO1 - predicted to be involved in fatty-acid oxidation - 'catabolism'.)

- Pa1857: no hits for experimentally-determined models. Computational models appear to be inner-membrane proteins.

Do sequence similarity and structure simultaneously. Be more optimistic about top hits (I.E. FAH's.) *Pseudomonas.com* analyses are also relevant. Conservation of gene on *Pseudomonas.com* on 'Ortholog group members' on gene page.
