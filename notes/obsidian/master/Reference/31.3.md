*Summary*

Data looks good use in a presentation, but could use a bit of work on embellishment. I need to get a plan out to Daniel asap.

*Graphs from fpscreen (29.3-31.3)*

I need to clean up the code and raw data so that they're both a little more interpretable. Key thing is to make sure that *Sa* cultures are labelled for TSB (Tryptic Soy Broth). For now however, the graphs made are serviceable.

It'd be nice to expand into the dotplots as well but I'm not sure how to keep data all on the same graph, at least for now!

*Graphs: unrefined*
