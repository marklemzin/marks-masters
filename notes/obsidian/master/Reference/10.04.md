*OH NO!*
I was very busy on Wednesday. Too busy! With experiments which took until 11pm, at which point I gave up and split them into 3 separate days. 1 day per *Pa* strain (PAO1, PA14, LESB58). I'll write about yesterday in retrospect.

Goals and aims should be to get an experiment each week:
- 1 ecological theory
- 1 transposon mutant
- 1 microscope video
A 'hot off the press' philosophy for Daniel. I think he'd appreciate the smaller stories.

I did get some photos though.


*A curiosity: agar invasion*

Daniel has suggested that the adhesion is due to a production of proteases that cleave the agar to form inclusion pores (think of volcanic rock.) I like the idea, maybe proteases will crop up again later too....

*Hamish Spencer's talk*
Woah this dude is super-smart. I'll take a look at the two books he recommended:[ Lewontin's Genetic Basis of Evolutionary Change](https://otago.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma995290701891&context=L&vid=64OTAGO_INST:OTAGOUNIVERSITY&lang=en&search_scope=all&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=all&query=any,contains,genetic%20basis%20of%20evolutionary%20change&offset=0) and [Kingsland's Modelling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology.](https://otago.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9953233301891&context=L&vid=64OTAGO_INST:OTAGOUNIVERSITY&lang=en&search_scope=all&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=all&query=any,contains,modeling%20nature:%20episodes%20in%20the%20history%20of%20population%20ecology&offset=0).

And finally Spencer's magnum opus.

- Library copy. That is not yet present.

*Various papers from Sam*
- Biofilms as molecular sieves: [npj biofilms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-019-0107-4)
- Corresponding protocol: [*Pa* methods and protocols](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-3473-8_11#DOI)
- Behavioral *Pa* identification: [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.15.618380v3)
- Bacterial motility? Not too sure about this one... [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.29.615714v3)

No time to take a closer look just yet, but the behavioural paper could be extremely useful.

*LESB58 growth*
One more try! I'm doing 3 technical replicates. See the setup document. I'm doing this because the machine we have is built to parametrize a well-established model. No doohickery necessary.

After that I can do fluorescence after 16h.

*Daniel's suggestions*

- Daniel has asked for a plan! That's not a problem as I've written down plenty of ideas already. I'll write it in 3 phases: optimization, ecology, and clinical applications. Emphasis on parasitism. An image to represent ecological modes.

- Fixes for the coculture experiment. Try use the tissue homogenizer (3-5mm glass beads). 1uL of culture total!

- TM15. Choose some mutants, let Daniel know. Try some anaerobic swarming. Don't forget to add nitrate.

- Mixed imaging. Take OD1 of *Sa* and OD1 of *Pa* in PBS. Image immediately for GFP/Red. Should be easy?

- Fit a logarithmic curve to the growth-data. I'm not sure how to handle fluorescence.

*Peptoids: actress again current code*
4 relevant boxes:
- Shuying 1
- Shuying 2
- Lyophilized peptides
- Daniel's peptides

*Rose, again*
I've let Rose know that I'm wanting to get a session to see if a pilot study with plastic-bottomed plates is possible. With 48h notice. I'll get a response, hopefully soon.

And...

1pm Tuesday! All other events are off, I need to get my first images.

*Keith, for the first time*
I asked Keith for some basic details on the 8th floor confocal microscope.

*DBO/SAHA*
Daniel's agreed to get me more DBO. Yay! He's asked for me to check Sigma but their DBO is ['discontinued.'](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/NZ/en/product/aldrich/199338?srsltid=AfmBOooNc09HH8MP0H_y9bEiJ-M9MG0StZCIsSqU4QlpOkjsbeyp6dCQ)

No luck with Sapphire biosciences either.

It's supposedly a ['putrescine analogue'](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1_4-Diamino-2-butanone-dihydrochloride#section=Chemical-Disease-Co-Occurrences-in-Literature).

*Jumbled-jambalaya thoughts*
- Self-determination: an inverse relationship between frequency & symmetry. Not sure what the exact parameters are though.
- Exploitation. As in a 4X game. Resources must be completely exploited. Could this be the inverse-frequency I'm thinking of? - something like a static optimum.
- Fractal creatures leave fractal hoofprints. Convergent patterns are beasts that walk the evolutionary savannah.

*Laboratory grade humour*
- She's been eating nothing but burgers for weeks-on-end and I am operating on the memory of coffee vapours.
