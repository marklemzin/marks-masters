Why do I bother mention ecology and complicate a simple problem? The problem is in simplicity. Too often we are content to imagine the most interesting phenotypes of a model system as being spontaneous. Everything has a cause.
Ecology as a field has made the mistake of oversimplifying systems. Ecologists are wiser now yet we still associate a certain *just-so* storytelling with *them* and not *us*. Obviously we are just as guilty of simplification as them. Moreso even because microbiology is difficult. Difficult science lends well to simplification.
When I... discuss the pattern-formation intrinsic to biofilms - I am well aware of the crudeness of my interpretation. I describe the localization of patterns, *but not genes*, so I analyse something that is not strictly biological. Nonetheless. I believe we can gain something from studying the environmental context of genetic expression.
For the majority of bacteria I suppose growth would be in biofilms, moreover, in dense polymicrobial contexts. How species localize is crucial to understanding the functionalities of genes in environmental contexts that are significantly more plausible. More plausible than monomicrobial biofilms at least.
