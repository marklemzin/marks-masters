03.03

My various unfiltered, and uncensored, ramblings - mostly here as a thinking space for myself but could have useful snippets to use in academic writings.

The top of each entry will have the most important information.

I will not provide all my references here. This file format does not work well with citation managers. I'll add web links to the most important citations.

Most notes earlier on are on the literature, some about more abstract ecological science, and others about more practical techniques, such as standards for image parameters. All of these will be unlabelled.

Methods on lab techniques, such as microscopy parameters, will be labelled clearly.

Other creative thoughts will be towards the bottom of documents, as they'll be written towards the end of each working-day.

I'll do my best to write a weekly summary of these documents. If this isn't possible chances are the images linked to each entry will cover the main points on a week-by-week basis.

Generally though, this should serve as an indicator, or running journal of problems that I'll encounter, be they more experimental, or theoretical. I like putting focus on the visual aspects of science so there'll be lots of pictures.
