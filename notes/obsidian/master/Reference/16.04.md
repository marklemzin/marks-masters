*Progress on fluorescence microscopy*
Access to the 8th floor confocal unit acquired. Training becomes possible if Kartik replies - if not I could speak to Jaydee's crew.

... They gave me the name of their postdoc, Alex Leonard.

*Agar length/drying optimization*

Key improvements:
- Pre-mix cultures to prevent spread limitation.
- Use the inverted-beaker method.
- Keep to 1.9mL media, minimum.

*Peptoid per plate calculation*
Petri plates have a diameter of 85 mm and volume of 25mL. 6-well plates have a diameter of 3.5 cm.
The corresponding volume is ~4mL. Per well we would need 0.8uL (for 5mg/mL stocks) and 2uL (for 2 mg/mL stocks). Fairly minimal volumes. A full rescreen should be no problem whatsoever.

*TM15 mutants of choice*
For my meeting with Daniel tomorrow. See [12.03](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/blob/main/notes/12.03.md)!

*Coculture coloration*
I've set up a plate with 3 lots of 75 (USA300) and corresponding lots of 317, 323, and 446 (*Pa* strains). I'll take 50uL of each, mix them together and screen for GFP/FarRed production.

*[Literature stuff](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-08491-1_15#Abs1)*
I wonder if it's worth reading about CF/CW pathology. Maybe Daniel will offer a book chapter? 

Studies have looked at rates of morbidity in patients co-colonized against mono-colonized with *Pa/Sa*.
- *D. melanogaster* - *Pa* has enhanced virulence with other microorganisms.
- *Children, CF* - higher levels of inflammatory markers in the lungs (IgG, IL8, neutrophils).
- *Children, CF* - prognosis is worse. Brasfield scores are lower, FEV1 reduced, and lower 10-year survival.
Authors have tried standardizing study parameters:
- Patient's characteristics. Concerns study populations. Patient age since younger kids tend to have *Sa*, CF phenotype (types I-VI; I-III are severe), and confounding factors (diabetes).
- Sample choice. Concerns patient inclusion. BAL are ideal due to a lack of contamination. Oral swabs are easier, great for younger patients (more *Sa*), and patients that do not cough sputum (expectorate).
- Infection definition. What defines a *Pa/Sa* coinfection is poorly understood. Some parameters are sputum species proportions, lung colonization sequence, and actual time coinfected - if the coinfection becomes monomicrobial.
