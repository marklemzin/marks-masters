*Summary*

I've been working on getting my thoughts out in a single extended essay. It's taking a while to get through the theoretical mud, but I should be getting into talking about practical experiments tomorrow.

Let's forget about MECs (minimal ecological constructs) for now and return to cells and genes - more familiar concepts. Cells can be thought of as collections of MECs. I believe that every species of cell can form multifaceted relationships, some parts that could lead to fatal interactions, and other parts that are necessarily mutualistic. It seems almost implausibly unlikely, from a statistical perspective, that a cell can be so specialized, for example, to have gene products that are unusable by other cells, and to be uniformly antagonistic.

Likewise it is a statistical paradox perhaps, that cells can find value at all in the raw components of others, given that there could be a great chance that trans-cellular genes find the opportunity to cooperate. But such a thought rests upon an assumption: cells need to be cut from the same evolutionary cloth. *Pseudomonas*, for example, can be thought of as an evolutionary jack-of-all-trades, and could be thought of as a vector to genes with a great many more functional aspects than the genes of *Staphylococci*. For *Staphylococci*, these cells are best known to be mammal-associated commensals, and could have genes that are better-adapted to living in the infection/wound environment.

Let's take another step back. In a lab-cultured biofilm environment, as with on an agar-plate colony, there are stages in biofilm development: reversible attachment, irreversible attachment, maturation, and dissipation. During this time it well-understood that there is a kind of ecological succession, with *Pa* coming to predominate *Sa*, at least in the CF lung. It makes sense that besides species ratios there could be a change in *Pa* and *Sa*'s broader ecological relationships. As far as I'm aware - an 'ecological perspective' hasn't been much explored in biofilm development, less so in polymicrobial settings, and not at all for *Pa* and *Sa*.

*A brief aside here to discuss the esoteric: I have my own thoughts and perspectives on biology, philosophically speaking. One problem that I haven't gotten a foothold on is how ecological time (changes in polymicrobial borders) and evolutionary time (when mutants are generated) are related. In my head it makes sense that adding a transposon library (or a mutagenic substance) instead of a single strain is somehow 'like' waiting for a long time for a wild-type strain to find the perfect adaptation. What differs between such techniques is not immediately apparent. How does normal growth without any experimental intervention, differ from something like a mutant library?*

*I'd think that there was a difference, but it would lead to all sorts of strange ecological propositions: like that 'mutational stochasticity' can be experimentally counter-selected. If there was no difference, between ecological and evolutionary time, then I could just say that we could use a transposon library, or some other method of introducing mutants to biofilms, to show that the same ecological patterns (heterogeneity or overgrowth) are selected for, despite the nature of the initial strain. It feels as though there is only one step to get to a biologically optimal phenotype, but this seems unrealistic.*

*But what's the point of using a huge mutant library? - I think that it's just a form a experimental hyperbole. If an entire organism, with all of its genes can afford to lose any amount of functionality, and still behave similarly, it goes to show that the genome has redundancies. It shows what the cell has so much incentive to achieve, that it is willing to create compensatory systems, knowing that it risks losing its primary mechanism of enforcing an ecological relationship. The details are just that - mechanistic details, and not of immediate interest (unless we're looking to manufacture a drug.)*

*Where matters become uncomfortable, is when we'd want to use two mutagenic species.*

[genetic-ecological-stochasticity]

*Some loose thoughts - I'm not sure if this is a valid perspective. The idea would be to use gene function 'similarity' (convergent/divergent phenotypes) to predict cell-to-cell relationships.*

During early stages of biofilm establishment, cells are known to use motility systems, such as the flagellum of *Pa*, to seek out attachment surfaces. [It's known](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6910820/) that *Pa* can direct itself towards *Sa* by process of chemotaxis, and attach to the surface of *Sa* cells. The process is something like how ants can follow a pheromone trail, with pioneer *Pa* cells using a pilus to follow a trail of PSMs (*Sa* surfactants) towards the *Sa* colony. As an ecological interaction, it's unclear whether *Sa* gains something from *Pa*'s sudden proximity, but this could not be an indiscriminate relationship, as *Pa* does move towards *Sa* to a create a more heterogenous system. What *Pa*'s ecological incentive is, is a more complicated question. In a closed system where *Sa* does not regenerate, if *Pa* and *Sa* were perfectly co-evolved, it makes little sense that a motility system (pili - or flagellum) would exist if it were used to eradicate *Sa*. *Pa* could feed from *Sa* metabolites, or provide a growth factor for *Sa* in exchange for waste-products, or even cull the *Sa* population for nutrients, but *Pa* should not outright eradicate *Sa*, lest the pressure to retain motility is lost. While such a model is unrealistic, it does seem to model early biofilm development, as there are perspectives that *Sa*, rather than *Pa*, is the key species in early biofilms. As the biofilm matures, the payoff for *Pa* from keeping *Sa* alive could wane for *Pa*, so the growth of *Sa* cells is instead repressed.

*A better model needs to account for the source of the gene pool for Pa and Sa - that they aren't cut from the same genetic background. I have have no clue how I'd handle this - it feels like something that would be solvable, but it's just a little beyond my abilities for now.*

The paper in the previous paragraph, the one about *Pa* chemotaxis, uses a 2-dimensional experimental model. Some very short glass frames are put onto a sterile microscope slide, which is then used to cast a very thin layer of agarose gel, that has been spiked with nutrients. A drop of culture is placed onto the gel and then 'sandwiched' with a coverslip slide. The slide is kept in a temperature/humidity controlled microscope, for up to 8 hours (in methods that I've encountered.) Using high-resolution light microscopy, *Pa* and *Sa* can be told apart by morphology alone (rods/cocci).

At the confocal centre, we have access to only one PC2 microscope, from what I understood from Rob. The '[Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System](https://www.otago.ac.nz/omni/confocal-microscopy/cm-equipment)' has a growth chamber and is able to be used with PC2 organisms. I was showing the slide model to Rob in the context of the paper above - which does not use fluorescence, he was talking about using digital contrast, so I'm not sure if there is any option for fluorescent imaging. The only trouble is that the system requires the shape of the plate to be explicitly defined, or that we use a compatible plate (like a 24-well plate, which is not the same as a microscope slide.) It seems that it's made to be used for high-throughput screens.

For more developed biofilms, it's better to look at static biofilm colonies. We can use fluorescent strains, such as strains with plasmids overproducing fluorescent proteins, to highlight the key structures of biofilms. *Pa* could form a structure that encapsulates *Sa*, for example. At a macroscopic level, biofilms of *B. subtilis* have piles that form tunnels which can transport water - like little microbiological aqueducts. Maybe either *Pa* or *Sa* be part of a macro-cellular transport network. Studies with mutants look at an alternate history, where something is not present to create a certain biofilm structure. For macroscopic visualization, Rob sounded like he recommended different microscopes.

The other machines were under PC1 restrictions: 'Dragonfly', 'Zeiss 900', and one or more of the 'Nikon' microscopes. Rob talked over these more quickly, and I didn't catch what he was saying - I'll get back to him to reiterate. I feel like I mentioned low-rez, fluorescent, no live-imaging to him, but maybe he didn't quite understand. But I can't blame him - I don't think other people will have done anything similar. The trouble with all of these is that we need to find a way to seal plates prior to sending them out for visualization.

Going back the Phenix microscope (high-throughput system), there is also the chance to use a microslide system. We'd be looking at biofilms in liquid cultures here but it'd offer us the chance to do some proper confocal work, as the structures will be 3-dimensional.

*Table of experimental options*

| Gene system | Regulator | Output | Rationale |
| ----------- | --------- | ------ | --------- |

A table like this could be a good way to explain which mutants are experimentally relevant.

*Confocal cost tiers*

Small note for Daniel: the tiers act like an annual subscription. The hours expire at the end of the calendar year, but if we run out beforehand, we can buy more hours at the rate that the tier we purchased offers, instead of buying hours at the expensive casual rate.
