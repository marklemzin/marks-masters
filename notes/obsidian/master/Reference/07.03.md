*Summary*

Alright this is feeling like this project might *just* be possible with the support for pattern-making research. Next step is to figure out what common strains of Pa and Sa are capable of.

It'd be nice to make a table of common coculture/confocal parameters. It'd help with experimental design.

*Lars' review*
A [nature review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00692-2#Sec1) from 2022. We're going to need a bigger document.

As something of note it's a huge relief seeing that people agree with *my* perspective, that being that spatial heterogeneity, beyond measurable gradients is something that depends on colony establishment, for example, that it need specialist cells.

This opens an avenue for treatment possibilities. What if all we had to do was to make sure that intraspecies gradients were disrupted, so that they could no longer support interspecies relations? Kill the roots and the rest will fall with it... Now the only problem is to decide what makes an intraspecies gradient.

Sections they will focus on: interlinked gradient-formation/physiological-differentiation, division-of-labor, and greater stress-resistance mechanisms. They take a 'holistic perspective'. This is inescapably ecology.

Gradients have their roots in developmental processes, such as that of morphogenesis, but has been taken to a molecular level, such as that of O2 gradients, only fairly recently.
Like plant and animal cells, the bacterial cell, though less organized, does live in a self-created group of environmental gradients.

It's neat that in embryogenesis, the metabolic by-products, such as those found in anaerobic fermentation, are enough to seal a cell's differential fate. Tumour cells can cross feed by taking fermentative end-products, such as lactate and use them for OXPHOS. In plants hypoxia, at least in parts of the plant's development, is enough for cell specialization.

There is a concept of metabolic subpopulations. Each bacterial community, as made up by varying nutrient availabilities, is there to feed other subpopulations. This review claims that the biggest determinant, be it macromolecular or energetic, is that of O2 concentration. Topological segregation, of physiological-distinct subpopulations, is there to link cells to O2 energetically.

Really though it's less about physiological distinctions, so much as it is about metabolic flux. Sure the potential (energetically speaking) of a carbon atom may change as it goes from glucose into acetate, imagine it going from the oxic biofilm border to anoxic core, but this is less about the cell and more about the flow of energetic potential. It's glorified biochemistry. I feel that biology, in all of its complexity, doesn't follow the same linear arrow of change that we know from biochemistry. It's more like how tides swirl as they ebb and flow with the lunar calendar, and don't just go up the shore and back to the sea again...

*This looks like a phase-correlation diagram. Not every cell is doing the same process all the time - their roles instead shift as one thing becomes available, and some other thing is transferred away*

It's curious that the response to diffusible nutrients, they talk about indole metabolism, is less like a physiological signal, so much as it like an 'adaptogen'. They are signals that reward bacterial flexibility, as in when a cell can know that it is next to epithelium, to start to express its virulence factors ('bring out the big guns').

The next section is on Pa my beloved. It has a bunch of ways to cross-feed: denitrification, mixed-acid fermentation, and phenazine reduction. Pa has access to 4 possible terminal-electron acceptors. He writes about phenazine oxidation, in particular, as it is a usable terminal reductant, at least for Pa in the biofilm's anoxic core. There is some interplay too, as even in fermentation, these compounds can help with energetic balance. There's a trade-off to being in the oxic biofilm component, as there are less carbon sources available, even though there is plenty of available oxygen.

Another gradient is that of lactate. Anoxic cells make it during mixed-acid fermentation, but it can diffuse out into the hypoxic/oxic regions, making cells adapt to acidic conditions.

At a molecular level, there have been structural analyses, at a genetic level, of proteins like RmcA, which can sense compound redox statuses, and respond by making the matrix SA greater, to promote biofilm O2 diffusion. Other links to colony SA, are things like Pa c-di-GMP, and a system that needs more than one signal in *E. coli*. 

There's a section on cyanobacterial mats. Not the most exciting, but it's neat that these cells can carry out carbon mineralization, due to changing pH/carbon availability. This creates distinct biological layers. During the night when no sunlight is available, at least for photosynthesis, the biofilm instead depends on feeding from built-up metabolites. I wonder if there is a way that Pa and Sa biofilms can store food for themselves? They also write about localized calcification, which implies a spot in a biofilm which growth is accelerated, something like a sweet-spot from overlapping gradients.

Next is a section on physiological heterogeneity. Their example is *B. subtilis*, which can follow roughly 3 phenotypes. The first is sporulation, then matrix production, then motility. There is symmetry here, as the spore-forming and motile cells are on the top and bottom of the biofilm - opposite sides. The middle of the biofilm contains matrix-forming cells. Likewise the growth states of cells are stratified. Oddly enough the centre of the biofilm contains the most exponential-phase cells, and the top/bottom extremities, which are either oxic or anoxic, have cells in transition/exponential phases. They looked at the RNA/ribosomal content.

Electrogenesis (using bacterial biofilms). These use an artificial acceptor, such as labelled acetate, which is mounted on an electrode. Only cells in close proximity, though normally contact, will use this substrate. There is however, curiously, another band of metabolic activity, that Pa cells can use around 11-12um from the electrode.

It's cool that this division-of-labour, or specialized physiologies, can also have immune interactions. Using *Y. pseudotuberculosis* as an example, cells on the surface of a biofilm can 'defuse' (neutralize) NO stress, so that cells inside can have an easier time beginning growth. This sounds a lot like Pa knocking down Sa's metabolic flux.

In dental cavity formation, there are three key bacterial layers. (A) cariogenic streptococci (B) non-cariogenic streptococci (C) non-streptococci. The sequential arrangement, has been shown to be key for environmental acidification, and the (B) layer helps to protect (A) from chlorhexidine. Again is this not like Pa covering Sa?

As a kind of inverse example, it's cool to find that gut O2, which is gotten from the epithelial vessels, is cut from the lumen by aerophiles, to permit anaerobe growth.

The trouble with biofilm antibiotic tolerance, is not the tolerance *per se*, so much as it is the low level of permeable antibiotics. Once these enter the core they gently select for resistant bacterial cells. **Now this is a question for Sam**, pathways leading to antibiotic resistance, are distinct when the stressing antibiotics are graduated, and not sporadically generated. Metabolite contribution: Pa phenazines to ciprofloxacin-resistance, and adding O2 to *Aspergillus fumigatus*, a fungal pathogen, would lead to more active cells and potentiated antifungals.

Gotta say the cheese example given, something about Emmental, is good fun but not something I could get away with referencing.

But in conclusion, I think metabolic analyses, be they at a visual or genetic level, are a little out of my depth for the time being - I don't have any great model of which usable measurements, and where they should be applied yet...

*Out of the nature frying pan and into the npj-biofilms fire*

I got a [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39979272/) to this review from the previous one, and can't not follow up on it - it's pretty much about what I care about the most! Heterogeneity. Pattern-forming. Mmm my neurons are feeling saturated already.

The spatial structure of a biofilm can come from environmental imprinting, or a cellular self-organization. *The former absolutely, the latter is radical*. We can say that cells are in single neighbourhoods, but that these may potentially coupled. Maybe even coupled in a kind of biological synchrony.

They call it a kind of environment-bacteria feedback-loop. I think this is something like a cell changing its environment, which makes a different signal, that makes cells behave differently. It's almost like normal signalling, except that it happens extracellularly.

Simply put it is a complicated process. There are references, that while independently good, do not consider that things like cell morphology, initial cell density, inter-species dynamics, and laminar flow, may all have interdependent interactions, which create a pattern together.

Cells are often inoculated stochastically, and this is enough to change cell spatial patterning. Ref 45, however, says that control of cell starting places is a possibility.

Growth and death rates can be linked to physical/chemical-microenvironments, but can also work through contact-dependent interactions, for example, with predatory cells, or bacteriophage.

There's no reason to explain active motility. Passive motility, that happens when cells simply divide, happens in response to fluid flow and cell crowding - and cell morphology. Cells can arrange themselves, not on chemical stimuli, but by simply morphological changes. Maybe this links to Sa SCV somehow.

Each cell can have a different microenvironment. Isn't that a headache? What a headache ugh there can't be an easy way to resolve this right?

From a physics perspective, cells are more like grains of sand than biological entities. The sand itself has properties, but so does the space that the cells occupy. There's a cool way to describe this interaction, it's on the tip of my tongue - but I can't quite remember. It's about how sand-piles can stack upwards and then collapse with by adding one singular grain. Physical interactions, like grains of sand touching one another, can accumulate, but can also result in massive restructuring. The environment itself, like embedded agar, can be viscous intrinsically, or by cell-localized matrix. It can regulate osmotic pressure, promoting community expansion. Cell crowding can affect competition indices, as well as lead to growth arrest!

Nutrient availability, this is something that is *almost* synonymous: but not quite synonymous, with the chemical environment. This means how much cells can divide and produce biomass. The final biomass in particular, is important, as too much or too little can change colony patterning. It can also facilitate chemotaxis, and may affect the physical microenvironment. Biofilm parts can change the surface tension / media viscosity (as would making cells embedded in agar).

They use a term called emergent cell-cell interactions (14, 16 and 58, 94) but I prefer spatial synchrony. It's also important, that when considering measurements, it is not possible to change one parameter experimentally, without other shifting as well...
Here's an example. Let's think about two complimentary auxotrophs. They can grow only by cross-feeding interactions. If we were to add the limiting nutrient, let's say an amino acid, then the link would be perturbed. But suppose that one species becomes motile with greater AA concentrations, and so with greater AA concentrations, the degree of intermixing *increases*. That's weird and unexpected, and a great result! It's just really important, perhaps, to keep an eye on lots of parameters, so that you don't just jump to conclusions.

Oh Lord this review really is perfection itself.
It even gives me the experimental setups.

*Stylistics*
This [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36824979/) has neat naming convention, where the key experimental strain, a phenazine-overproducer, is given focus with a unique name 'BigBlue'.

*Ramblings*
What happens at the limits of 'incentive' models, that ask how cells can access a resource?
