*Daniel's comments*

- Long-term coexistence for LESB58. He'd want to look at 5+ day colocalization. Pictures every 12 hours. Daniel was concerned about agar-drying mostly. I could try pre-humidify my culture hotbox.

- Triculture experiments could use a blue-labelled wild-type. Blue will make for much more impactful figures than black.

- TM15-induced anaerobic metabolism- could be indicative that some other signal is messed up, like ppGpp. TB-specific drugs are known to affect the cell membrane - maybe they can be used alongside TM15 (or to disrupt bacterial swarming.) Maybe we could look at surface damage with TM15 using EM.

- CFU rescreen. I'd only need to focus on 1:100 for PAO1/PA14 and 1:1 for LESB58. I can finish this assay on Saturday.
