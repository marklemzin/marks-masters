*Notes from meeting with Daniel*
- Pa3602. Guilt-by-association. Look at literature for glutamate synthase analyses (could try supplementing media with glutamate.) KEGG glutamate synthesis pathway too.
- Other mutants are of interest.
- Pili involved in toxin secretion is an alternative hypothesis.

*Subsequent readings*
	[*Pa* can detect *Sa* neighbour peptidoglycan *via* Pa0601 - a gene involved in virulence in coinfections](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1214550110). Pa0601 is a putative 2CS with similarities to LuxR-family transcriptional regulators. Pyocyanin production in wild-type cells is roughly double in response to GlcNAc and peptidoglycan. Pyocyanin production occurs in parallel with elastase. The two are interlinked by *pqs* signalling. Pa0601-KO protects flies from killing during coinfection and in murine coinfection models. Clearance of Gram-positive flora prior to infection protects cells from clearance with Pa0601. The Gram-positive bacteria are killed by *Pa* in a Pa0601-dependent manner.
Curious we'd assume that pyocyanin production must co-occur with other virulence factors. **Even weirder that *Pa* is more virulent in 'dirty' polymicrobial environments.**
