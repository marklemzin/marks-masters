*Compatible cohesive ends*
While *Spe*I may not be appropriate Daniel did mention something called Compatible Cohesive Ends. The idea being two restriction enzymes a similar enough at a restriction site that ligation is possible. *Xba*I and *Spe*I are compatible for example.

- pUCP22 digest. *Eco*RI and *Xba*I. (4702bp backbone and 27bp MCS chunk.)
- pSEVA247C digest. *Eco*RI and *Spe*I. (791bp CFP and 3481bp backbone.)

Should be a-ok. The resulting pUCP22.CFP post-ligation doesn't *really* need to be confirmed. But if necessary a subsequent digest against pUCP22 should confirm insertion.

*Add citation for vectorNTI!*
Might be a touch challenging finding a citation. The software is fantastic though.
