*Deb's screen, a preliminary search*

Walking through the desert... of conserved hypothetical proteins. I will need automation. Alternative is to focus on named genes only, but I'll miss those recently labelled.

*Stochastic distribution*

Cells should be homogenously distributed by default. 

*History*

Changing the ecological fate of our colony - such as by adding an invader - causes a succession to occur. Hamish would be interested.

*Image overlay*

Supposedly involves imageJ. I couldn't get imageJ to work.

*kdp?*

God help us all. Adding PBS to resuspension media abrogates swarming in *every single condition.* K+ is important. How? For another time.

Anaerobic swarming is also important. We don't know whether swarming occurs anaerobically. Sam (and me) kind of thought anaerobic growth wasn't energetically sufficient for swarming motility.
- Don't forget nitrate.

*Occam's peptoid*
If it inhibits swarming, it must mess with the flagellum.

*Accursed genes: usp*
Would the heptamutant be worth testing?
