*Very scuffed Sa transformations*

I'll see how it goes...
Success on all fronts apparently. Unexpected. Only the 2 arcing strains to retry tomorrow.

*Maddie's overexpression collection*

- 377 - 393 in the *Ec.* collection. Fairly varied genes but will need a *lot* of plasmid extractions. Will require Gm50.

The corresponding strains:

Gm50 for oe *Ec* and LB for everything else.


*Mini-collection: pqsA*
The *pqs* regulon differs based on the gene deleted. [Transcriptomics of *pqsA* is described here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2901523/). Key dysregulated genes:
- *pch* - most operon members. Siderophore synthesis (other one is pyoverdine). Upregulated. Could try *pchD*, *pchA* (one will have a polar effect), *pchR* (regulator).
- *opmD* - OMP. Upregulated.
- PA2274 - hypothetical. Upregulated.
The rest aren't overwhelmingly upregulated. I'll keep to the genes above. The *pqs* operon probably can be modified by exposure to *Sa*. Not everything shown is everything relevant.
