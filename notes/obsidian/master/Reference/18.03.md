*Summary*

A very long and unproductive day. Key things to do tonight or tomorrow:
- Write up a simple plan for Daniel. This is based on the Venn diagram, and rests on the types of bacterial interactions.
- Get my head around the fluorescence microscopy, and make a summary for Daniel
- Complain about the growth-curves (to Daniel)

---

*Some R code*
This is where things get complicated, unfortunately.
[Code for growth curves](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/blob/main/r-code/18.3%20growth-curve%20fluorescence.R)
[OD600 - 308, 309, 311](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/raw-data/17.3%20pilot%20308.309.311%20OD.csv)
[GFP 480/511 - 308, 309, 311](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/raw-data/17.3%20pilot%20308.309.311%20eGFP.csv)
[YFP 500/543 - 308, 309, 311](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/raw-data/17.3%20pilot%20308.309.311%20YFP.csv)

Note that the YFP values, while they worked great were pulled from David's (Fineran) protocols. I'm not sure why the wavelength is elevated, but it works well!

No growth in TCM, for any of the bacterial cells. Seems a bit weird as even plain DMEM, should work!

Note that data must be converted to .csv. It's nothing special and only needs the time column to be replaced with numerics (I.E. 1 instead of 1h.)

*Notes from meeting with Rob*
These are unorganized. I'll compile them for Daniel tomorrow.

- Brightfield - requires a stain
- White light phase - looks too similar to background, low contrast
- Phase contrast - can punch through agar, but not well set up.
- DIC  - something like shadows?
Buying tiers
- If we run out then we get the tier pricing as casual hours.
- Runs out at the end of the calendar year.
- Maybe no charge for pilot or training. Train on their samples then try our own sample then next time! Could do overnight studies here. But then do analyses early! It'll help with optimization.
DIC + phase contrast = great for a single cell resolution.
Would be ideal to fix samples for the PC1 conditions.
Problems for macroscopic. Fl only, maybe need to fix...
- Flip sample or not
- PC1 or PC2. Find a way to fix the sample maybe.
- Shallow petri dishes, imaging cover. Maybe hot glue a small container shut.
Speak with Daniel.
Digital phase - a 'pseudo-phase' needs to take multiple photos. Digital reconstitution. 'Stable' - actual platform does not move.
Might be problems with phase contrast.
'Zeiss LSM + 900' - single cells. Also has a big old incubator. For sub-cell resolution, then around 20 minute exposure.
'Dragonfly' - very fast imaging. Can nuke cells with lasers.
'Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System' - enclosed so no drift. Shifting microscope head. There's a chance to use microslides. Locked to particular plates, but need to build a template. 'Imaging plates, slides, dishes' - thin glass surface (refractive index 1.4). Maybe for 96-wells, could be useful for many media conditions. PC2! Can also do humidity control.
Not set up well for PC2.

*Some methods for Rob*

More methods for agar colonies
[Link to review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9748781/#RSOB220194C30)!

- 'Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed with a temperature controlled LSM510 inverted microscope (ZEISS) equipped with, a GFP filter (BP470/40, FT495, BP525/50), a CFP filter (BP436/20, FT455, BP480/40), an mCherry filter (BP560/40, FT585, BP630/75), an X-Cite 120 mercury lamp (Excelitas technologies), and a Zeiss AxioCam HRm camera.' - [antitoxin-codependency](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839403/#sec4)
- 'Confocal imaging was carried out on the LSM 700 laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) using the 20× and 50× objectives and the associated Zen software. A square piece of agar containing the entire colony was cut out and placed on slides without a coverslip for confocal imaging. For all other imaging procedures, entire plates were imaged without disturbing the agar surface.' - [mucoid-dominance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4000849/), see [supplementary 1](https://www.pnas.org/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1073%2Fpnas.1323632111&file=pnas.201323632SI.pdf)

More methods for agarose pads
From experimental review (2025)

*Why should I use confocal, when light should be enough for these papers? Maybe we could try fluorescently-labelled proteins. Makes sense that protein co-localization, is a better result than cell co-localization. It's kind of like a protein ecology, rather than cellular ecology.*

*Is there a way to label diffusible, or otherwise extracellular, proteins? Many of them are already fluorescent, at least for Pa siderophores.*

- 'Bacteria were immediately imaged with an inverted Nikon TiE or Ti2 at 37°C for 8 hr. Images were acquired with a 100x oil objective (1.45NA) with phase contrast and an ORCA Flash4.0 Digital CMOS camera (Hammamatsu).' - [Original (chemotaxis to Sa)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6910820/) and [follow-up paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11389416/#s4).
-  'This microscope was equipped with a motorized Z‐drive, a Lumencor SpectraX light engine LED illumination system, a Hamamatsu ORCA‐FLASH 4.0 V2 camera system (16‐bit greyscale images with a resolution of 2048 × 2048), a CellVivo incubation system and chamber to control the environmental conditions, a FITC SEM fluorescence filter to measure GFP signals (excitation = BP 470 ± 24 nm, emission = BP 515 ± 30 nm, dichroic = 485).' - [Pa-ESKAPE-coculture](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11445780/)

*Glossary*
- *Epifluorescence microscopy:* pretty much just 2d confocal.

*More lit planning*
Some categories of literature
- Monomicrobial biofilms. Sa and Pa biofilm development. (Pa reviews: [Rehm](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/22/8671), [Atif](https://journals.lww.com/jcma/fulltext/2018/01000/Bacterial_biofilm_and_associated_infections.3.aspx/1000?casa_token=SP1XlAP7xPIAAAAA:cbeLqKxS2gs8jolM_rONkZ9a1IqyGi6GBhW9e13hpbKX-l4baBiMZ3UKH2O9Y0HuA_z1NuRh2UnAVEhoXiror1U), [Lin](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.955286/full))
- Strain information. Not sure where to start in this subsection. The big question is whether Pa or Sa have had prior co-evolution, so I guess I need to compare/contrast the strains.
- Sa and Pa polymicrobial interactions. 4 groupings: antagonistic, cooperative, parasitic ('cheaters'), predatory. Paragraph each, need names of critical genes.
- Biofilm analyses. [Good review for experimental methods](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39979272/).
- Theoretical analyses. Same review for [measurements](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39979272/), but also try [this review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36227846/).
- Ecological models. Not sure where I want to go with this section but [synchrony](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132516), [fundamental metabolism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10670014/), and [recent chaos models](https://softology.pro/voc.htm) are all possibilities. Also try self-organized criticality.

*Results from pilot growth curves and fluorescence*
I used a pretty simple script that takes OD600/fluorescence, every 30 minutes. During idle time the plate is shaken in a double-orbital pattern, at 300rpm.
There was 100uL per well, total... maybe this is too little?

Good news is that strains grow fine in LB, and that the YFP strain, #311 (PAO1 pUCP.lacZ-Pro-YFP-1), works great! No luck for GFP (PAO1 pUCP.rpoZ-GFP-1/2), but this will just need adjustment. I'll try 395/509nm, which is the [entry for GFP in fpbase](https://www.fpbase.org/protein/avgfp/).

No growth in the TCM, regardless of antibiotics, or strain. I might have made this up incorrectly. Maybe something is wrong in [the media encyclopaedia](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/experimental-setup/13.03%20media-encyclopaedia.xlsx)?
