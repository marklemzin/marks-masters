*Ordered today*
- Cuvette boxes x5 ~$90

*Some requests from Daniel*
- Email Maddie, she had a project that would be using confocal microscopy. My guess is she wants to look at protein localization. I'll tell her to send an email to Rob, as her project differs from mine substantially.
- Request a *PC2*-friendly microscope. I guess I'll need to go back to Rob for this.

*Microscope parameters*
It feels like we're asking Rob to find the Loch Ness monster. I hope that at least one scope will have the parameters we need.

- PC2 only, no shortcuts with sealed vessels possible
- Macroscopic (5-10mm diameter; like 4X/10X lens on a conventional microscope)
- Fluorescence: can do GFP/YFP/mCherry/Far-red

Nice to have:
- Incubation chamber (temperature/humidity controlled)
- Brightfield illumination

*An example: Ecological neutrality*

*Loose thoughts*

- Cooperation, or coercion?
- Hybrid modelling

*Colony topography*

Could I use some kind of confocal technique, only on the surface of biofilms? I would not need to punch through agar and would instead would end up with something of a geographic map.
