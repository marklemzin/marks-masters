*Experimental notes*
Could be worth looking into complementing the *pqs* transposon-mutant. We have MHQ. Maybe something else in Iain's box in the 4C. Take a look at the -20C list too.

*Colony size pipeline*
6-well plates have a well diameter of 3.5cm. Measurements have been made accordingly.
- 446 monocultures not visible at 10h.
- 0.5ag conditions consistently grew larger colonies.
- Same with 0.5lb conditions.
