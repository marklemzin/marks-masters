*Merging images*

I've successfully written an imageJ macro which takes all the input files from one folder (.jpg) and merges them into an output folder (as .jpgs).
Two critical functions:

- run("Gamma...", "value=0.7");
A decent way to standardize image intensity. By no means perfect. I'm not sure how Gamma-passing works.

- run("Merge Channels...", "c1=RedDup c2=GreenDup c3=Blue create");
Both the red and green channels are occupied by *Sa* (red in reality - but yellow here) and the blue channel by *Pa* (green in reality - but blue here). I'll keep the false-coloration since red-on-green is very difficult to distinguish.

Take a look at the [following folder]() for merged images.

*Glutamate complementation*
Solubility is roughly 8.6g/L. Corresponds to roughly 60mM (147.13g/mol).

Calls for filter sterilization. Autoclaving will degrade proteins. So I need to make a glutamate stock. 

The justification is a touch murky. BlastP undoubtedly returns the protein's class as an 'FMN-binding glutamate synthase family protein.' From Google: the enzyme is involved in ammonium ion assimilation to facilitate glutamate synthesis. [Reviewers are uncertain](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11120-004-3478-0). The enzyme contains an FMN binding domain so is involved in redox reactions. *Glutamine* is a necessary pre-requisite for glutamate synthesis *via* the glutamate synthase pathway. Glutamic acid is the ionized form of glutamate.
