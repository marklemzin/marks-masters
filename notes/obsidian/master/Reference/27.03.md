*Summary*

Last little stretch! I want to write about a couple of papers to kind of show how my theory has implications, and what the follow-up to . After that it'll just be cutting down to 1 page.

**Parasitism**

Could also be thought of as 'opportunism.' One species provides an exotic function to another, but the act is not reciprocated. The 'parasite' (often called a 'cheater') may provide a commodity, or even repress growth of the 'producer' cell, but the 'parasite' shouldn't overtake the growth of the 'producer' in a genetic and ecological vacuum.

In terms of genetic segregation, this is an odd case out of my 4 scenarios, as it needs species to have an asymmetrical distribution of functionalities. To be explicit, the 'parasite' must have an exploiting regulator gene, and an *unrelated* producer gene. In the counter-case, the 'producer' must have an exploiting regulator gene, and a *related* producer gene.

In biological terms, this means that one species must control a common signal which the other species can only ever be modulated by. It's a trans-cellular version of the same genetic circuit that makes intracellular feedback loops possible. We could look at genes found in functions where *Pa* or *Sa* could either sense or produce a response to an oncoming stressor, which could affect the partner species to some extent. My first guess is that phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) or any of the *Pa* QS molecules (surfactants mostly, but also HQNO) could be a part of a parasitic circuit.

*If I had to choose one - I think this one is the most difficult to conceptualize. I'll write about this one more later but if a similar pattern occurs at different biological levels (genetic/trans-cellular), I'd guess that the species would be distributed fractally. Think of the 'parasite' like how a fire spreads through a dampened forest, or vice-versa.*

**Antagonism**

Where species exchange commodities. The species behave like in a mutualistic relationship, but both species produce a signal that is native to all cells anyway. Cells could have to deal with metabolite accumulation (possibly toxic) from both native sources as well as exogenously, from the partner cell's metabolism. Evolutionarily speaking, the overlap of the *Pa* and *Sa* 'secretomes' would most likely occur at the metabolic level, through any of the small-molecule by-products: pH (H+), reduced carbon sources (in an anaerobic biofilm), or reactive-oxygen species.

**Predator/prey**

Where species are so different, that they can find no value in the partner species beyond nutritional value. Alternatively, where cells must eradicate competition, maybe to push a more niche isolationist lifestyle (which cannot tolerate competition.)

At an evolutionary level, this occurs when the other ecological strategies (mutualism, parasitism, antagonism) are less valued than partner eradication. How such a barrier could be calculated, or even conceptualized, is well beyond me for now.

*Happy to discuss theory in person - but this is not a problem I've got a foothold on just yet...*

This is what we think of when we talk about canonical polymicrobial interactions. It's funny because in an ecological vacuum, they're the least likely relationship (assuming coevolution, discussed earlier.) Toxin secretion, contact-dependent killing, or even intrinsic growth advantages; all are bactericidal.

The 'prey' to the 'predator' must be so insignificant, so unnoticeable, that it is almost eradicated on accident. We must be very careful to not confuse predator/prey relationships with parasitism. They are not equivalent.

*An accidental diagram (hopefully humorous.) I was thinking and playing around with ecological relationships, and they somehow ended up in a grid that resembles the political compass. For context: the left-to-right scale would measure the distribution of capital (socially-distributed to privately-owned) and the top-to-bottom scale would show the distribution of political power (centralized-management to grass-roots management.)*

**Eco-genetic gradients**

*Or - 'heterogeneity is not homogenous'*

There is a trend towards measuring colony heterogeneity, as a proxy to showing ecological relationships. There's a great list in this review on [detecting heterogeneity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36227846/). My problem with work like this is that - as Sam would say - there is no biological basis. It'd be nice to have a review that gives examples, like 'sector width' shows not only 'heterogeneity' but is also a way to show how much cells have grown from a frequently single-celled bottleneck, a representation of colonization potential.

But how could we use something a model in a project? Based on our experimental design (agar-plate colonies) our data would be of static ecological settings. If we could simulate, by means of a mathematical model, the biofilm's development *in-silico*, we can measure how close our data falls to the predicted biological optimum. It's about whether our system has optimal behaviour, if we expect it to follow a particular behavioural pattern.

*An example: DLA and mutualism*

Adapted from [this paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8319339/).

This is a paper that takes a look at the behaviour of 2 complimentary strains, lacking either Nar or Nir (genes involved in N reduction,) and their distribution on polymicrobial agar-plate colonies.

Their main conclusion: enough of one mutant is enough to determine, statistically speaking, which direction a metabolic gradient (N reduction) flows over a spatial region. The mutant which is in a higher density in the inoculum, will go on to form the outer layer of the bacterial colony. The paper does not explain the fractal distribution of bacteria.

This doesn't invalidate their conclusions, but it's kind of a shame that they don't go any further with the fractal idea given how eye-catching it is.

Their 'fractal colony arrangement' doesn't remind me so much of a fractal shape as it does a process called diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA). DLA is something I had stumbled upon over the Summer as part of my recreational research, and it's nice to see it pop up [in biofilm modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038109810000281) as well as this paper - completely coincidentally.

DLA itself is a pretty simple algorithm. A single point is placed on a toroidal plane (the top of the x-axis is the same as the bottom of the x-axis, and the same for the y-axis) and one-by-one, pixels are spawned at the borders and allowed to walk randomly, until they contact a stationary pixel. As more pixels aggregate ('aggregation'), their random walk is less likely to reach the core of the aggregated-structure ('diffusion-limited').

Taking a biological perspective, we can look at each 'branch' of DLA as if it were made of 2 ecological gradients. The first is the line going out from the core - they explain this as the pressure from growing cells to force each other out towards uncolonized space, and the second line is the one that cells spread out concentrically along, to restrict access to the nucleating cell. This second line is less simple to explain biologically, but we could think of it as cells having pressure to form borders with the complimentary strain, as a part of the experimental mutualism of this model. What the basis for forming borders is on a genetic level: maybe motility, maybe chemotaxis, or maybe just overgrowth, but this is not explained by the paper.

[2d-dla]

It's a bit strange that DLA could be driven by physical cell interactions entirely, at least when looking at the data presented, since some of the DLA branches begin at the border and extend into the colony's core. Cell-to-cell pushing should only extend outwards from the colony core, but it's clear here that DLA can go towards the colony core too.

From an ecological perspective, DLA presents a model that maximizes homogeneity, leaving us with a choice between either parasitism or mutualism. The strains in the paper lend themselves well to a mutualistic model, where a single partner cell grows out into a pre-colonized population of partner cells. Two factors predict plot colonization: a plot should be far enough away from the self (for example: no NO2- accumulation) and should be close enough to the other (for example: a partner than can turn NO2- into NO.) Visually and biologically, this is much like how *Pseudomonas* cells swarm.

As a thought experiment, if we add more and more cells of the colonizer to the media, it becomes becomes less likely that the cells are able to expand freely to maximize homogeneity, and so form smaller and smaller DLA structures. When the biofilm is saturated, cells cannot undergo DLA-style colonization - since the biofilm is already homogenous.

All to be prepared fresh.

As resistance decreases (more CAA, less agar,) nodes occur more frequently (angle intersect reduction.) Shows that what goes from the core outwards becomes more important for tendril-formation. Maybe slow-growing strains have different symmetries. I'll bet that the parameters (core-to-out, concentrism) are somehow inter-related.
