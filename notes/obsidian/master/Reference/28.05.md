*Reducing image noise*

Notably a problem with 317/323 (PAO1/PA14) coculture fluorescence. Some strategies in imageJ:
- Gamma-pass. Works well for normalizing brightness. Sits around 0.7.
- False-coloring. Map GFP to blue and FarRed to yellow.

Michael must have some kind of suggestions here.

*Daniel's suggestions*
- Cellsens. Software!
- Coculture with non-fluorophore *Sa* and *Pa*. Should rule out GFP localization.
- lacZwp01q2. Take a look at the rough position.
- *lasR* or *rhlR*. These deletions are appropriate.
- Long-term stability of mutants in coculture.

*Loose thoughts for Daniel*
- Adding mucin and FBS (or albumin) to LBa to reflect physiological conditions.
- Blue! I want more colours...
- I've sent Deb's LESB58 tn-seq results to double-check with Daniel.
