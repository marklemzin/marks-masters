*Swarming re-optimization*
My notes make it sound like I've used [un-modified M8 media](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24818898/) (I would have switched to standard media for RNA-seq experiments - it does make sense...) I've taken a look at some of the parameters I've tried in the past, the best swarming I've gotten does come from un-modified M8.

I've linked downloads of the key plates below, though there's more pictures in the [raw data](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/tree/main/raw-data) folder saved as .tif files.

*First experimental set*

(Incubated for only 16 hours - not 24)

*Second experimental set (Congo red)*

Somewhere on the backup drive, I didn't save these from the plate-reader.

*Third experimental set (different inoculum volume/density*

(Bottom right looks like the colonies I used for RNA-seq)
