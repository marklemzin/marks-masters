*Agar thickness problems*

I see pretty big differences in microcolony distribution between thinner/thicker agar. I believe the agar loses moisture despite the humidifying container. For 16 hour growth, it may be not a huge problem, but I'll need something better for multiple-day growth (for LESB58).

Truth be told, what really has me wondering is what I'm actually looking at. The curves remind me of intestines but they don't look like any other recognizable biological pattern.

*Growth curve logistic modelling*

Bioinformatics takes time. I'll set aside an evening for this.

*Micro microscope pilot*

Some pictures with the upstairs inverted fluorescence microscope. Inconsistent light source makes imaging challenging. Some trends nonetheless emerge. Fluorescence images are from 15mm-thick agar.

GFP-lit PAO1 localizes on the agar indents seen with BF microscopy. Curious that only PAO1 is located in the BF indentations. Maybe Daniel's hypothesis of protease tunnelling has merit.

*Nota bene. Could try image overlay for blue. Subtractation.*

*Peptoid rescreen*

All according to plan. I've used 40uL of peptoid (100ug/mL) and 4mL of agar. Incubated at 6pm.
