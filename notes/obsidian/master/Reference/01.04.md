*Summary*
I've gotten most of my plan/summary written. I'll edit it tomorrow. If I have the time, I'll add a section on the DJK-5/Colistin paper. That'll be a great first lead that I can extend outwards into a more substantial experiment.

Michael's email is next on the list after writing the experimental summary.

*To do:*
I feel like I haven't written anything for a while. I'll write up a small plan to keep track of everything.
- Keith's seminar notes
- Finish writing my research plan (summary, editing)
- Add some comments of alternate interpretation to the DLA case-study (DLA/parasitism)
- Take a look at Michael's email, his figures in particular (also section on microscope)

*Keith's seminar:*

I ran into Klem and showed him the hexagonal swarming. After some deliberation, he asked if I had tried different inoculums. Hypothetically, different inoculum volumes, could lead to colony 'blooming' symmetries. It's like how crystal volume (think of something like a Quartz crystal) affects crystal symmetry.

Thoughts from Keith:
- Digitizing visuals, using a brightness threshold function (either YFP or blank).
- Looking at volumes of colony subsections. I have noted down 'surface microcolonies are smaller over time' and guess that this means that Keith looked at cells that accumulate at exocyst structures.

*Putting everything together*

- Species interact at least 4 ways (even all 4 ways simultaneously,) and there are macroscopic patterns associated with each.
- Genes will have functions that can be grouped by what ecological state they promote.
- Species in a biofilm are not thought to be 'ecologically neutral', there is almost always some kind of ecological state.

Putting everything together, it makes sense to say that we can 'visualize' gene functionality at a macroscopic level. What can we do with this?

The first step is to look at what experimental factors determine microcolony shape. Factors could include experiment variables: inoculum density, inoculum ratio (see [Deb's review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33576132/)), agar concentration, and media nutrients, *but* could also be extended to genetic variables. An early assay should look at how different strains behave. We'd compare between how LESB58, PAO1, PA14 grow in the context of LAC300 to get a big picture of which genes determine microcolony patterning. I haven't looked at what differs between the *Pseudomonas* reference strains, but I've heard that PAO1 and PA14 come from different lineages (the other one was PA7?), and I'm sure that I've heard that LESB58 is part of either the PAO1 or PA14 lineage.

*I was thinking more of a Venn diagram originally but I guess a standard curve is close enough! Most genes are freely interchangeable (fall into the centre of the Venn diagram) between Pa strains.*

After we have an idea of what the main pattern that *Pa* cells form with *Sa* - whether species are arranged homogenously or heterogeneously, then we can begin to ask which genes are actually responsible. We have a number of tools to help us guess correctly: one is from experimental data, the other is from fundamental ecology, and the last is a bacterial collection.

- TnSeq data. When this comes rolling in we'll get a picture of what genes are needed for clinically-relevant biofilms. One caveat is that the cellular microenvironment (metabolically and immunologically speaking) will differ between a mouse to and an agarose plate. The mutant data will still be a good way to filter down the number of possible genes to investigate. I'm sure it'll tie in well to the current literature on *Pa/Sa* interactions.

- Ecological patterning. There are parallels between how genes are distributed, their ecological functionalities, and how cells are arranged in biofilms. Key to such a model is 3 parameters: microcolony heterogeneity (species mixing), macrocolony species numbers (*Pa:Sa* ratio), and changes in interspecies dynamics over time. I've just read over Michael's (Michi's?) email and he seemed to be able to look at growth on agar over time - so it's something we could possibly try too. I'll write a commentary today or tomorrow.

- Mutant library. From what I understand, our *Pa* TnSeq library allows us *quickly* to screen many knockout-mutants (Tn-insertion; but we'll assume that they're equivalent) for changes in biofilm patterning. We'd just have to get a plasmid inside the corresponding mutants. I guess that this takes no more than a day for electroporation and selection. It's by no means high-throughput, but it means that we have more chances to get a mutant with a really significant phenotype.

Finally, after we know which genes are needed for changing the ecological state of a biofilm, we can look at how such genes can affect a clinical infection. For our agar plate-based experimental model, it'd be best to look at antibiotics, or other such treatments that can be spotted onto the colony directly. As opposed to counting CFUs, or another invasive assay, spot-treatment can keep the biofilm intact for post-treatment visualization (which can then be harvested for CFUs, or other more invasive assays.) I'm not sure which antimicrobials would have the strongest effect on biofilm heterogeneity at sub-MIC concentrations. For example, we could try some of our antibiofilm-peptides if we know that cells cooperate by contributing exotic components to the EPS, so that we chemically-abrogate one incentive for cells to co-operate. In other words the treatment should align with the ecology of the biofilm.

It makes sense that we'd want mutants that are more susceptible to a treatment. Returning to the previous example, mutants that produce less biofilm are less likely to cooperate on this front already, so it makes sense that the susceptibility pattern (if you think of it like antibiotic synergy) between a biofilm-production mutant and anti-biofilm peptide will be at most additive, rather than synergistic. We know that biofilm disruption, while a severe cost to bacterial fitness, is not lethal *per se*. But assuming a change in the biofilm's ecological state, maybe more targets will reveal themselves when we ask what keeps cells alive - and from not killing each other - in the biofilm post-treatment. How well do cells behave in a biofilm when their primary strategy is chemically abrogated (by antimicrobials) and their backup plan is no longer available (due to knockout of critical genes)?

The genes to look at would be in the inverse of genes that determine typical biofilm ecology. The mutants from the screen of genes key for infection (TnSeq data) that have no apparent phenotype, could instead be key for survival when co-operation (for example) is not possible. The mutants would only differ in colony morphology post-treatment. From an ecological standpoint, the mutants would lack genes that are involved in backup ecological strategies, so loss of them could well promote the primary ecological strategy, since there are fewer genes that could compete with the primary phenotype. For example, inter-species killing could be key for keeping cells in an alarmed state after antibiotic treatment, but could prevent cell co-operation under unstressed circumstances.

*Science fiction*

It only hurts to idealize in retrospect. I'll conclude with a little about the sort of places I'd want this project to take me - answers to the little biting problems I have with my perspective on biology.

Gene distribution

How well species related-ness predicts species co-operation is classic problem. It flows on from 'kin-selection' from classical genetics ('I would gladly give up my life for two brothers or eight cousins' - those sorts of vibes) and that general direction of research. I find statements like this to be something of a paradox. How much is there to gain from an isogenic twin, ecologically-speaking? It makes sense that we'd better co-operate with something that offers an exotic function, a service that our own biology lacks.

The best way to answer a question like this is to take two organisms, and randomly mix their genes; 50:50 a gene goes to one organism or the other. The cells that result would be likely to have a mix of genes from both organisms, in what could be mapped by a binomial distribution, but this is not the number of cell pairs that would subsequently grow. How similar/dissimilar cells would need to create more cells that are capable of independent growth, or strictly cooperative growth is the difficult question.

It's not hard to make a statement like 'more horizontal gene transfer means a lesser tendency to co-operate.' The hard part is to design the subsequent analysis/experiment. Such an experiment *starts* with genetic stochasticity (something like hypermutants, maybe?) of two species and then *ends* by saying how many of them were obligate mutualists, and how many survived independently.

I'm not sure if there's a way to exchange genes between species so efficiently yet, so the easier analysis would be bioinformatic. We can take the inverse statement, that cells that tend to transfer genes are likely to have a greater propensity for gene-mixing. If the donor then loses the original function, then species can become mutualistic.

But HGT is a niche evolutionary case. If we think of genes as memories to a stress or demand that may no longer be ecologically significant, then as memories often do, they themselves can perpetuate the situation-which-created them. It's a kind of convergent mimicry. If cells need to compete with bactericidal toxins, then that stress will persist so long as there are 2 species in the world: one bactericidal and the other naïve. That host may then create a demand for its own antagonism, resulting in pressure for other strains to produce bactericidal toxins. The first host may then keep its counterbalance (an antitoxin system) but lose its toxin system. The result - a transfer of gene functionality. Such is the case for bactericidal genes. The way that other genes are transferred likely follows a different dynamic.

And so how *Pa* and *Sa* behave is a mystery of origination. If we knew what stressors that *Pa* and *Sa* encounter which makes them behave the way they do - it'd be less about how *Pa* and *Sa* as bacteria interact, but how much *Pa* and *Sa* create synergistic environments. Is there much of a change between the nose and soil after all? And if a cell once knew a time and place- how much time must pass and how far must it go to forget?
