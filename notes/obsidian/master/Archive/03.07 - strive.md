Look upwards outside. Tree branches are supporting the sky. Atlas is not man but multitudes. A sapling extending upwards. Ivy on a self-imposed scaffold. I believe we determine ourselves. The phylogenetic tips of a movement - crashing into the sky, splitting into multitudes. But fracture is not weakness. The scaffold remains standing. The sky remains upwards outside.

We communicate in synchrony. Not long ago was tongue cleft from palate, so the heart remains the source of communication. We understand each other. So admit your weaknesses in debate and the opposition will follow you. I often catch myself debating with others. The common argument for a particular belief is a shared human understanding. Yet we often assume ourselves too similar to others. When I fear I assume others are also afraid. But other responses are equally human. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance are equally positive as much as they are equally natural.

Man has a debt to repay for existence. For half her life, you invest in yourself. The body must be repaid eventually. The heart and head will be reclaimed too. Our very existence is the product of biological confidence. I will not betray her trust. But I will use her gifts selfishly too.

My mind is shivering. Waves strike against dikes repeatedly. Somewhere above, the moon is probably smiling.
