The ocean itself is a plural. Less water, more *body* of water. A *collection* of thoughts.

Have you ever lifted your face in a storm? The rain is blinding obviously, but the rain running down your face is different to tears. I feel people have a connection to that particular coldness - it reminds me of a sensation of forgetting. I remember the feeling of wading along the coast until the coolness of the ocean disappears.

I've seen people travel to the ocean habitually too. The travelling is significant. Even people living next to the coast *travel* by swimming in the ocean. I go to the ocean to unburden difficult thoughts. To me, it is a checkpoint of sorts. I've imagined many other people feel the same, even though our exact reasons differ.

People travel to the ocean, droplets fall from the eaves, and into alleyside gutters, through streams, joining with fresher waters from far-far-away mountains - and the ocean drinks everything. Whatever dregs remain. Water is something of a universal solvent. I wonder what memories precipitate somewhere far in that abyss.

My thoughts intermingle with yours. Yet I find a distinction between *you* and me. You are a boat floating on an empty ocean.
