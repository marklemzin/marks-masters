*Agar thickness problems*

I see pretty big differences in microcolony distribution between thinner/thicker agar. I believe the agar loses moisture despite the humidifying container. For 16 hour growth, it may be not a huge problem, but I'll need something better for multiple-day growth (for LESB58).

*Growth curve logistic modelling*

Bioinformatics takes time. I'll set aside an evening for this.

*Peptoid rescreen*

All according to plan. I've used 40uL of peptoid (100ug/mL) and 4mL of agar. Incubated at 6pm.
