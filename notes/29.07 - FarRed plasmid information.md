*Plausible cut sites*
None visible within FarRed itself. I will go with *Not*I or *Asc*I and *Bam*HI. Should give a 700-900bp fragment (FarRed) alongside the remaining backbone - 4800bp.
500ng for a digest: 250ng for a gel.

*Fluorophore information*
The fluorophore sequence is given in Daniel's database. Could be useful?
