*ChatGPT: spatial data*
Recommended to use packages 'terra' and 'spatstat' for analysis of spatial data in R. The docs are provided here:
- [spatstat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/spatstat.pdf)
- [terra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/terra.pdf)
Subsequent analysis recommended something like Ripley's K or Cross-K tests.

Cellular automata can be programmed in R. I will need to be creative though. Check the chatGPT thread for packages.

Images will need to be doctored to remove undesirable segments (colony border and core). Use complete black as the colour can be easily filtered away. The lowest brightness is not black in the images.
