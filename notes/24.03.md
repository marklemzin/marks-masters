*The plan - rewritten*

I like some of the ideas I've had in the past week but they need to be rewritten. I've had a number of terms crop up -

- Evolutionary exotic
- Evolutionary commodity
- Ecological Other
- Ecological Self

- Equilibrium
- Gradient

- Cell survival
- Cell death
- Bilateral relationship
- Unilateral relationship

*Glossary*

I liked the way that I wrote the following, but some words are used extremely loosely. I think that for an initial plan, it'll be good to give my thoughts in the way I'd write about them to myself - so I'll keep them in and instead make a little glossary.

- Trajectory. The opposite of a biological optimum. Something in biological motion.

*Gene distribution*

Within the same prokaryotic cell, gene products cannot always touch one another, 'signalling cascades' can be spatially limited. The same idea applies at a macromolecular level, where gene products cannot always travel freely in-between cells. It follows that gene-to-gene interactions, such as those found in a biofilm environment, could also be dependent on space: how close and how far cells are - from one species or another, can affect trans-cellular signalling.

In such a model it is impossible, at least in ecological science, to think of biofilms as a heterogenous cell. When we ignore spatial dynamics, it is normal to think of biofilms as an ecological 'black box.' There are inputs and outputs like an enzymatic machine (in go nutrients, out goes biomass) which change along an ecological gradient. Biofilms may act as a well-oiled machine, and with a certain Darwinian optimism, may even be thought to be on a trajectory (evolutionary) towards acting energetically optimally. But are there an alternative perspectives, perhaps?

I propose that in a complex ecological model, that there can be pockets of evolutionary stagnation. Imagine, that a cell enters an equilibrium with another. The participating genes coevolve, and both gain an optimized function. However, this novel function becomes situational; a function that is active only when the gene product is in proximity to its partner. Such a specialization, however beneficial can, with even a slight change in the host cell's surroundings, becomes evolutionarily backwards.

The nature of adaptation over time, however, is not a core component of ecology. What is instead relevant, is how cells behave when they *sense* their environment. Instead of thinking about evolutionary trajectories, we can think of expansionist phenotypes. Instead of thinking about evolutionary checkmates, we can think of interspecies equilibria. And genes don't need to 'co-adapt' to have spatially-restricted behaviour. Cells have never feasibly evolved in isolation. They are well-adapted to both the current environment of the Earth, and to the other cells that likewise inhabit the Earth. I do not feel that it is a coincidence, or some evolutionary fate, that two partner species will almost always have some degree of genetically-driven interaction.

*A thought for Sam. Can we think of cells as being assembled from pre-determined-genes, like how we know what cards exist in a rogue-like game? Or as we could know what we could draft in a deck-builder? Do genes exist before they are made?*

Let me take a step back again - cells can be thought of as a unification of genes. Isn't it strange that genes are split across many different species, when they could be part of a greater super-organism? That parts of the biological code, like parts of a greater evolutionary machine, are strewn between cells separated by membranes, when they could be part of a single being? Such a thought is not entirely a fantasy. Genes can be producers of many metabolites, or other extracellular particles, which have a role beyond the cell's barrier-like membrane.

Cells - crucially, need at least two distinct functions (as opposed to only 1 essential function, when taking an evolutionary perspective) to participate in ecological interaction: (1) a consumer module: a gene product that can respond to extracellular stimuli, (2) a producer module: a gene product that can change the cell's extracellular environment. These form the genes needed to create either a positive feedback loop (like a signalling cascade) or a negative feedback loop (I think of it as an equilibrium) in response to an environmental stimuli. The consumer module ('conmod') is there to turn extracellular signals into intracellular cues, which the producer module ('prodmod') can perform a response towards.

There is nothing intrinsically ecological about polymicrobial biofilms. Just as well as a a single cell can form a feedback loop, so can another species, and so can both species form an interconnected loop. With two species I can think of 4 ecological trajectories. For now think of cells as 'minimum ecological constructs' (MECs; I made this up for convenience), with only one conmod (consumer module) and prodmod (producer module). The conmod is wired to activate the prodmod, which goes on to manipulate extracellular space.

Let's say that two MECs have a matching conmod and prodmod - they are ecologically indiscriminable. Both MECs respond to the same regulatory signal, and both produce a signal that they are both responsive towards. If the background of such MECs is essentially isogenic, and both MECs start in equal numbers then neither should overgrow the other. But with even a slight population perturbation, one species will begin to overgrow the other. Such a dynamic (between two MECs) is balanced on a single chaotic point, which will often tip the scales in favour of one MEC like a see-saw carrying slippery weights.

Two identical MECs (conmod/prodmod) have a network that connects cells together, I.E., there are matching conmods and prodmods, but these do not form a mutualistic equilibrium, as there are no incentives to cooperate. MECs that are exact opposites (no matching modules) are also insufficient for cooperation. As prodmods and conmods become too different, there is less reason for MECs to interact at all. Such MECs have no shared commodity, or other such signal that a MEC could use to facilitate interactions, so cannot value partner MECs for more than their material components.

Suppose instead there are two MECs but each have a set of mismatching conmods/prodmods, with each conmod using a prodmod product from the partner MEC. Such MECs find a middle ground where signals are distinguishable, but also valuable to partners (like an exotic trade good.) Neither MEC can outgrow its partner until the partner's product loses value - such as by finding an environmental nutrient source. It's curious perhaps, that such states of 'genetic disorder' are statistically more probable, at least more so than MECs which have only matching conmods and prodmods, given that modules are free to be distributed between MECs. It's like how two liquids will tend towards perfect heterogeneity when mixed.

But what if such a signal trade is not bilateral, but rather only one-directional? Here MECs must be asymmetrically constructed. One MEC takes the role of an independent producer, and the 'parasite' MEC leeches products without any kind of reciprocation. Such a system is stable so long as the 'producer' MEC does not outcompete the 'parasite' MEC.

*Fig A. Types of feedback loops with two participants. From top to bottom **(A) Indiscriminate equilibrium.** Species are ecologically isogenic, and will overgrow each other when given a growth advantage. **(B) Discriminate gradient.** Species have an asymmetrical gene arrangement, and become hierarchically-dependent. Stable so long as the 'producer' cannot outgrow the 'parasite' species. **(C) Discriminate equilibrium.** Species are mutualistic. Growth cannot be easily decoupled, unless trans-cellular goods lose trade value between organisms. **(D) Indiscriminate gradient.** Cells do not directly interact. Growth is necessarily decoupled.*

*Falling isn't falling if there's no ground to stand on!*
If we think of there being a generalized energy gradient, (ecologically speaking,) where does it begin and where does it end?
