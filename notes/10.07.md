Mostly notes from my meeting with Daniel this morning.

*Print me black -pSEVA247C*
I printed a copy of the protocol for the GeneJet kit. Looks like I did everything correctly.
For cleaning cuvettes - I'll speak to Maddie about what she uses.
- Blu extraction attempt today.

*Motility assays for flgK*
Take a spot of bacteria from the colony and place on a glass slide with PBS. The mutants should be decidedly less motile than wild-type.
- Include in next microscope series. Could try picking sample from multiple locations in the colony: border, core, and intermediate.

*Confirming pqs complements*
Double-check the complements (*pqsA, pqs,* and *flg*) by doing a plasmid extraction and gel.
- *opmD* confirmation today.

*Sa transformation*
I need to speak with Prasanga about her success with her protocol. If she hasn't had too much luck, I'll speak with Sam instead.
- *Sa* re-transformation as soon as I extract more FarRed.

*Analyses of the 07.07 series*
- Intensity and heterogeneity analysis of the central quadrant- whenever I have time for bioinformatics.
- .tif 'blackness'. Maybe cellsens has a way to reconvert these .tif images into something immediately visible.

*Loose threads*
- Organize a meeting time with Hamish Spencer.
- Daniel seemed content with me leaving for Christchurch. I do want to get some success with *Sa* transformation beforehand though.
