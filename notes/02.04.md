*Summary*
I've spend the day primarily finishing my summary. It'll be at the bottom of this page, labelled with an 'underscore'.

Plan for tomorrow is to, uh, make a short-term experimental plan. I'll need to multitask to get those TM15 experiments done.

Note that lower fluorescence is not always an awful result from growth-curves. It's kind of like lowering the exposure on a camera to pick out features that may not appear when overexposed.

*Weekly meetings with Daniel*
- 10 - 10.30am. Don't forget!
