*The light at the end of the veritable tunnel*
- *in-vivo* (but not *in-situ*) analysis of chronic venous ulcers shows that *Pa* localizes deeper into chronic wounds than *Sa*. A caveat with such *in-situ* techniques is that they require preliminary treatment with PFA. [Measurements are in-bulk and determine the locality of macrocolonies.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2786634/)
Compare with studies looking at *Pa* forming a 'leading edge' in chronic wounds. The study above is not 'historical.'

[More generic review of colony biofilms](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9748781/):
- [Odd](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X04002604?via%3Dihub), but useful reference showing differences in colony morphology with changing agar concentrations. Ctrl+F for 'agar.'
- [*B. subtilis*: cell death drives 'wrinkling.'](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3503208/)  CFP can be used as a proxy for cell density (live/dead using cytox green.) A heterogenous Cell-Death-Pattern (CDP) is formed prior to wrinkle formation. The genetic basis for CDP includes: matrix production, stress-response regulators, and cell-cell signalling. Removal of toxin-producing-genes limits cell death. Cell death occurs at specific locales, it begins in regions of high cell density and the death-regions are highly structured (and occur at regular intervals.) Biofilm density (stiffness) affects how cells are 'pushed' through biofilms, and from [previous publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17025532/) the width of the 'wrinkle' pattern and frequency of occurrence ([more from physics journals](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.074302).) Cell death *precedes* the convergent forces driving wrinkle formation by 6+h. Therefore regions of high cell density promote cell death and drive agar buckling and subsequent wrinkle formation.
	- Higher-level theory from the same paper concerns mathematical modelling. 'Microbial pattern formation' requires differential equations determining localized density as a function of space AND time. [A reference is provided.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23003092/) **The model is constructed on the theory that biofilm production limits 2d expansion.** Logistical model for growth but extremely suspicious assumption that habitats are 'suitable' or 'unsuitable' by a switch-based mechanism (consider metapopulation theory.) [The model appears fundamentally logistical.](https://www.pnas.org/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1073%2Fpnas.1212429109&file=pnas.201212429SI.pdf) I care more about an externally-limiting model of expansion.
	- Patterns can emerge from the convergence of trajectories.
Other categories tested had interesting categories: ppg hydrolase, 'cannibalism', T-AT, AB production, and respiration. Key measurements are wrinkle width and frequency.
- [*B. subtilis*: microoxic conditions drive colony rugosity.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3650226/) Wrinkling is specifically linked to microoxic respiration (abrogated by nitrate respiration.) Haem-containing cytochromes are somehow implicated given the sensitivity to iron starvation of the phenomenon (more wrinkles with more Fe3+.) Activity through a membrane-bound 2CS which senses redox status of cytochromes. The response is to increase colony surface area, to promote Oxygen uptake.
	- Dietrich has 2 papers linking anaerobiosis with biofilm formation in *Pa*. Here's [one](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2745639/) and the [other](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3624522/). I believe he will have made links with colony 'wrinkliness.'
I suspect the relevance of 'wrinkliness' or other 3d structures will only become apparent after doing some confocal microscopy.
- [*P. dendritiformis* (Gram +): has a fratricidal response to partner microcolonies - even outside starvation.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2851949/) The purpose is uncertain. Subtilisin as an exotoxin can promote growth/colony expansion at low concentrations but is lethal at higher concentrations. Subtilisin itself is not lethal but rather a 'suicide' toxin produced in response termed sibling lethal factor (Slf). Subtilisin exists primarily at the edge of the colony - it's a QS spearhead. Blocks invasion while internal levels promote nutrient acquisition.
Localized signal, cell, or nutrient accumulation seems to be a repeating theme in this literature.

*Loose-ish thoughts*
- Structures can be stochastically-formed (on one end of the spectrum - entirely by chance) or be part of a genetically-determined phenotype. A similar dichotomy to phenotype-dependent selection and incremental selection.
- Models work best on highly-processed data. Clever data summarization is half the battle in creating interesting models.

*More notes from Daniel*
- More mutants for the next *Pa* set. Try T6SS mutants and the USP heptamutant (in PA14). Try analyse Deb's tn-seq dataset.
- Agar rugosity.
