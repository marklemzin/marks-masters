*Pa* flagella are immunogenic. Synthesis is downregulated during infection of the CF lung and later lost at the genetic level. *flg* is more widely downregulated in *mature* biofilms (unusual - considering that colony biofilms are mature-ish.)
- TLDR; *flgE* removal leads to the formation of aggregated structures in biofilms (**our 'blips'**), increased biofilm production rate, antibiotic penetration (gentamicin & *colistin* specifically - DJK5 paper), but reduced expression of matrix-production genes.
- Reduced matrix production (*flgE* but not *flgD*) corelates with increased cell recovery after Gentamicin treatment (50-100ug/mL) - at least in 96-well plates with M9. *flgE* mutants were recalcitrant to treatments up to 800ug/mL. The effect is biofilm specific for gentamicin (200 vs 400), ciprofloxacin (400 vs 800) and colistin (800 vs >800). Gm doesn't appear to penetrate deep within the biofilm even when the biofilm is submerged in media.
- *flgE* cells accumulate at the bottom for 96-well plates (as with other non-flagellated bacteria - they grow where they land 'like an appleseed'). *flgE* mutants grow to higher densities than wt cells under static conditions.
- In a flow-cell environment - adhesion is limited (which doesn't actually matter) but biofilm production is enhanced. Perhaps mucoid strains of *Pa* can cause such phenotypes. [*flgE* biofilms have a strangely 'dotted' structure.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-021-01157-9#Sec2)
- *pelA*, *pelB*, and *cdrA* are strongly downregulated in *flgE* biofilms. *pslAB* less so.
There is mention of fluorophore-conjugated antibiotics... but they are extremely expensive.

	Lots of reading...
*mucB* could be an interesting *Pa* mutant to investigate. Maybe.
