mono bf images are surprisingly well-formed. Nothing interesting to report though.

Mono-images not super-helpful here. The algorithm does work regardless.

Generally worse performance for 10h images. No improvements for 323co-red series. Will stop performing 10h series.

Future directions:
- 446 *bf* images will probably come out well at the 24h time-point. But Red and GFP work appropriately.
- 323 heterogeneity doesn't come through in the analyses. Probably a problem with the auto_tresh function.
- *bf* images might be clearer at a later time-point.
- Algorithm handles 'red' really well. I'm not entirely sure what I could do with the Red data. Maybe try using the central column instead?
- Mono images are only really useful for #323.

TLDR;
323 mono vs. co seems interesting but needs additional work (pix-map does not reflect actual images.) Could use a quadrat-intensity test.
317 Red and 446 Red come up clearly. Intensity could be an appropriate analysis for an entire column (see 'red-signal eradication' section below.)
**2lb offers great resolution for all 3 strains (#446 at 24h only.)**
- Seems the most interesting results occur when *Sa* is given an opportunity to expand. Might be important for our confocal video series (16h tops.)
- Opportunities for fairly complex analyses. Can apply quadrat-intensity here.

*Red-signal eradication*
Signal-eradication occurs from the *inside* of the colony and expands outwards. GFP is also dulled.

*Two-replicate tests*
I'm looking for consistency within replicates *and* differences between conditions. Finding a usable number of bins for the quadrat_test function. 50 seems alright.
Usable data (*bf*):
- 317co-ctrl
- 317co-2lb
- 323co-2lb
- (not 323co-2ag)
- 446co-ctrl (24h)
- 446co-2lb (24h)

[Here is a list of R colors for future reference.](https://r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names_files/figure-html/thecode-1.png)

*Understanding FFT*
We start with a matrix of pixel values. The rows are converted *via* a 1D FFT into a complex number representing frequency changes. The complex number accounts for both magnitude and frequencies of change.
Complex numbers are equivalent to a + b*i*. I can think of the real component (a) as the x-axis and the complex component (b*i*) as the y-axis. This interpretation is complicated. The simplified variant is to rewrite frequencies in 'polar' form - z = R * e^( i * theta ). R is the magnitude (the vector for the point's distance from the 'origin') and theta is the phase angle (the actual location of the frequency.)
The horizontal 1D FFT will fit a sinusoidal wave along a row in my image. The vertical does the corresponding thing *but* 2D FFT's actually care most about the combined oscillation. The 2D FFT oscillates in both x & y directions. Each pixel in a 2D FFT image corresponds to a single '2D oscillation.'
When viewing 2D FFT images the 'phase' corresponds only to the magnitude component.
Kind of looks like a sci-fi warp-drive.

*Understanding Otsu thresholding*
Most thresholding begins with the construction of a histogram of pixel intensity frequencies. Most models handle bimodal distributions well. Otsu is one such case. Otsu measures the midpoint as being proportional to the probability of having a light/dark group pixel (for any given threshold value) and the mean intensity of the light/dark groups (for any given threshold value). The greatest value from an equation combining these parameters among all possible threshold values is selected as the threshold value.
The goal is to maximize contrast.

*Understanding quadrat tests for inhomogeneity*
The key component is calculating the average intensity per pixel then extrapolating out for each 'bin'. An average intensity of 0.5 becomes an average intensity of 50 for a 10x10 pixel bin. The X^2 test:
	(observed - expected)^2 / expected
holds up so long as all 'bins' are similarly sized.
Typically the variance-to-mean ratio (X^2 statistic) is plotted against bin-size.
