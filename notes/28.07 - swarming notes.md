Resistance papers for swarming motility:
- [Resistance to essentially every drug class](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7038238/)
- [Flagellum upkeep becomes costly in the presence of vancomycin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7043666/)
- [1018 reference paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8087004/)
Other notes, is that PA14 tends to downregulate motility late during infection. Motility is important for colonization.
