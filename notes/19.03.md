*Summary*

Today I woke up feeling miserable, and decided to rest. Sure enough when I got up I started coughing up phlegm and felt that my throat was extremely sore. I'll stay home today and tomorrow (maybe?) which coincidentally, gives me time to write up a summary for Daniel.

*Adventures in R*

[Code available here](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/blob/main/r-code/18.3%20growth-curve%20fluorescence.R)

More fun stuff here - I've gotten the AUC graphs, the only ones I'd use in a presentation, down to 30 lines. That's around 100 less than last year's code! The same cannot be said for the extended curves. I still need to use a lot of 'for' loops. It's stable code but really needs to be optimized.
The only change I would make before I get the rest of my data is bringing the fl/od curves, the ones that I use to show the curve's gradation, into a single unified graph. It would need 2 separate y-axes.

Fun little thing that I did add was add a simple glossary, so that I can switch between my own names for strains - stuff like '308', to readable names in only a couple of lines of code!

*N = 6, all in the same 96-well plate. Just shows that strains grew ok in LB. Funny that the auc is higher in media with gentamicin (Gm50), but it really doesn't matter for this experiment.*

![OD-tcm-analysis](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/graphs/19.03%20OD-TCM-analysis-17.03.png)

*As above but in TCM. This is where I encountered some problems. There's no growth! It's weird as I used the media from the [DJK paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-024-00637-y#Sec12). Only change on my part is that I'm using phenol-red-free media, that also has no glutamine (but I compensated with glutaMAX.)*

*Same as above represented differently.*

![YFP-LB-analysis](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/graphs/19.03%20YFP-LB-analysis-17.03.png)

*I ended up stealing the emission/excitation from the Clariostar. David from Fineran's lab (he's gone now I think...) had a protocol on the machine, where I pulled the numbers 500/543nm. When I tried what I had originally planned (513/527nm) the plate reader threw a fit saying that the numbers were too similar.*

![YFP-LB-curves](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/graphs/19.03%20YFP-LB-curve-17.03.png)

*Same as above except that here it's a little clearer that we hit GFP too. Funny that we get nothing from 480/511nm, as regular old wtGFP (what I suspect is in the strains I tested!) has a lower excitation: 309/509nm (from fpbase.)*

So where's the data on GFP? Good question - I was using the wrong emission/excitation (for eGFP, these probs have wtGFP). Next time I run plates I'll make sure to use only GFP/eGFP strains, so that I can measure both possibilities. I'm surprised, to some extent, that *any* of the strains use wtGFP.

*The plan*

I'll start from the bottom-up, with some fantastical theory. It's just the way I think - it's easier for me to start with a dream-like theory and try to build from it into something biologically meaningful. So as a brief thought experiment, I'll need you to stop thinking from a molecular perspective, and instead imagine yourself as an individual cell. The actual biological complexities, we'll later add onto this skeletal model.

![cell-diplomacy](https://github.com/marklemzin/marks-masters/raw/main/home-made-diagrams/17.3%20cell-diplomacy.png)

It should look familiar, but I assure you that any resemblance, is entirely unintentional. The source of inspiration, was instead asking myself with how few things I needed to describe a biofilm visually. I figured that I only really needed to know 2 things:

- Biofilm volume - as in the total space the biofilm occupies.
- Biofilm borders - as in the shape of the biofilm. Does it have rounded edges or does it have a large surface area?

The question is how this relates to the molecular perspective. I figured that biofilm volume is a great measure of a cell's competitive index. This is the odds that a cell will remove by force another, such that it takes over potential resources. The predator cell (as in predator-prey) may also scavenge leftover nutrients, be they from the prey cell's lysis or prey's metabolic by-products. It's best to think of competition stochastically, such that each cell-to-cell interaction is unpredictable, but that on a grand scale a set amount of cells will exist in equilibrium. At a macroscopic level, as an example, cells capable of anaerobiosis, as opposed to obligate aerobes, find a niche in the core of the biofilm for themselves.

A ratio of species in the polymicrobial biofilm, however, is not enough to describe a biofilm. That would be like saying that all you need are colours to paint a landscape. The other measure of cell association is distribution. For example, cells that produce a growth-limiting factor for other species may be kept in a very filamentous microcolony arrangement, so that they can give enough factor to delimit growth elsewhere. There's a lot of ways to measure spatial distributions, but I feel that a lot can be told from just measuring perimeter length: it's enough to tell you about microcolony distribution, and cell heterogeneity. Longer borders imply a lot of cell-to-cell interactions, either with empty space or with other cells of other species!

As an aside - at a molecular level, there's less need to think about uninhabited space, as compared to ecology. Every empty patch of space can be thought of as being potentially occupied, at least in the sense of a mature biofilm ecosystem. This is a pretty major assumption, as it relies on us saying that cell growth is negligibly slow, at least towards the centre of matured biofilms. This isn't to say that a model can't include cell growth as a competitive parameter, but rather that a model can't be built from the ground up with growth in mind! We'd have problems with chaos dynamics, if we were to try and include the dimension of time.

Imagine these two measures as axes on a cartesian plane. The further in one direction we go, the more a cell species behaves in one way or another. If we go straight North, a species may find that it has no effective competition, and even able to regulate other species. It seems that the mainstream perspective, at least in the older literature, is that *Pa* has such a position over *Sa*. The keystone species can either eradicate competitors (predator/prey interactions) or keep some around to feed from their metabolic by-products (parasitism). Down South, the case is the opposite, where cells behave symmetrically: cells may trade nutrients (mutualism), or both compete with the production of toxins (antagonism).

Obviously, a cell-to-cell interaction (that being what this graph really represents), I think would only rarely fall to one extreme - as species are likely not well-adapted enough, through a process like co-evolution, to have extreme polymicrobial policies. I like to think that much of what happens in polymicrobial biofilms, while seeming intentional, is really just evolutionarily incidental. Another assumption, but the lit will say whether the *Pa* and *Sa* strains I'll be working with have a history of co-evolution.

All this said - I feel that I'll be able to measure interspecies relationships (volume, heterogeneity). How I expect to find them is another problem. Let's pretend that we are evolutionary engineers, and ask what we need to manufacture an interaction.

- Predator/Prey: among the easiest to design - this would only need one species that produces a toxin, and a species that is susceptible to the toxin. *Pa* makes some bactericidal toxins (HQNO, *lasA*: there's a [review here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-08491-1_15#Sec5) on these that I haven't been brave enough to start yet!) that *Sa* is well-known to be vulnerable to. If we wanted a more extreme *Pa/Sa* relationship, we'd need to use an *Sa* mutant that is more vulnerable to *Pa*. The question here is whether a biofilm can change from cell death? Is there some kind of ecological benefit, at the level of the macroscopic biofilm, for *Pa* when *Sa* dies? Can a cell be more useful dead than alive?

- Parasitic: this is predator/prey interactions, but needs one species to have a non-lethal toxin and the other species to be able to provide a resource. *Pa* might be able to use the lactate from fermentative *Sa*, which is forced into such a metabolism by HQNO (Deb's review mentioned this, it's either from [this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30630428/) or [that paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25917910/)). We could try find an *Sa* strain that can use a carbon-source that *Pa* doesn't - and see how much *Pa* keeps *Sa* around! In this case both species have unique adaptations, but they are not directly complimentary.

- Antagonism: is almost a predator/prey interaction, but the prey has some tools to fight back against the predator. In reality, this seems like a comparatively realistic model, but it too has an illogical extreme. Is it ever possible for two species to be equals to each other? Even within a monoculture there can be isogenic enclaves. Instead what matters most to mutual antagonism, less so than fatality, is situational competition. *Pa* may be able to starve *Sa* but once in a blue moon [*Sa can outcompete Pa*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8426923/). If such environments, or situations, occur at an even rate between *Sa* and *Pa* then I would call it a perfect antagonism. Note that this can be a temporal effect, such that there is a cycle of when *Sa* and *Pa* dominates, if it depends on overproduction of a metabolite, for example.

*Spatial synchrony. What growth of a species could look like with perfect antagonism. An example, from [this review](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132516#supplementary_data). Note how infections (black - I think!) are phasic and follow a waveform model. Hosts clear the infection, then are reinfected later.*

- Mutualism/synergism: surprisingly, I think that this one is the most complicated to engineer. This needs both strains to be doing the same thing and from them to benefit from it. A good example, perhaps, is how *Pa* and *Sa* can both produce distinct biofilm components, that then [conjoin to form a less permeable biofilm](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4249327/#:~:text=We%20observed%20that%20the%20ability,together%20in%20the%20wound%20model.). I guess that a stronger mutualism, although 'stronger' is bit subjective, could be made by something like a [constitutive nutrient exchange](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8319339/)(I recommend this paper.)

Polymicrobial infection - is polymicrobial infection, but not all polymicrobial infections, even though they have the same species of bacteria, are necessarily the same. I feel that treatments for polymicrobial infections, be they drug or surgical interventions, should likewise be delineated. I think that if we could take a closer look at each of these facets of polymicrobial interactions, we could find some new ways to direct treatment choices in the clinical setting. Maybe it's better to treat mature biofilms, rather than developing biofilms. Maybe it's key to wait for *Pa* to overrun *Sa* before administering antibiotics, or maybe it's best to treat early while *Sa* has a relatively aerobic metabolism. Who knows?

For me however, I care more about what makes an interaction (antagonism, mutualism, parasitism, predator/prey): what genes are needed? And more importantly, if we can use more than one type of mutant to get the same relationship, is there a shared characteristic, such as antibiotic susceptibility, that is common to a certain cell-to-cell relationship?

*Notes for Sam*
We don't look at the downstream proteins in the anaerobic pathway. It'd be nice to throw in something like a cco1/2 double-KO, to really nail down the exact mechanism. But this is a matter of mutant choice! We could settle for something simpler no problemo, if the downstream stuff wasn't readily available.
